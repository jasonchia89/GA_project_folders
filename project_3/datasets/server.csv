,TalesFromYourServer,"Years ago, my first restaurant job back out of the military was at Longhorn.

Great job, it hadn’t been bought by Darden yet, so...that long ago.

Its a Friday night, we are working a 2 hour wait, the restaurant is full. (Which means the  grill is full etc).

I walk up to the booth I just got sat, a nice enough couple on a date.  They had waited 90 minutes to be sat.

As I’m schpieling, the gentleman interrupts me to tell me “I am deathly allergic to garlic, and onion and it cannot be anywhere near my plate.”

I go confused,  offer to get a manager since this is beyond my wheelhouse.

Go down to the line tell the GM and have to pull him off Expo. He goes “Ill talk to him”

I was off to the side.

GM goes. “Sir, I was told you are deathly allergic to garlic and onion?”

Guy on date: “Yeah, I can’t have it anywhere near my food.”

GM: “Well, I need to ask you to leave then as we cannot accomadate you, those spices are in everything we have except deserts, and I cannot guarantee the deserts haven’t had some contamination with the spices in the air. I’m really sorry but I have no food that is safe for you.”

Guy on date stammers and changes his story.

GM: “Sir you told me and my server you were deathly allergic, as in death, I’m sorry but please leave, we won’t serve you,”

and that’s how we rolled.

1-we later assumed he didn’t want bad breath on the date...carry a mint player!

2-It gets even better, to have even tried to accommodate him, we would have had to finish cooking the orders still on the grill, then clean the grill, then cook his food, then after it was out of the window now do the entire restaurants back logged orders that would crash the kitchen.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Not 15 years to the day you understand, that would be far too poetic and magical, but 15 years 'roughly'. I started working in a Chinese buffet place when I was 16, running dishes and scrubbing pots. I saw two grown women fight over a double-booked table, it came to blows, one pushed the other over, fried shrimp and cheap prosecco took flight, the husbands tried to intervene, they were unsuccessful. 

And on that day I became a man.

I would jump from services to retail, to hospitality then back to services. Hired, fired, re-hired, fired again, promoted, demoted, burned, scarred and have held ""almost"" every position in a restaurant outside of General Manager, to which I am very grateful for.

After 15 years I've finally bagged a non-services job, my last shift is Friday. Everyone at the place I currently work is sad, my manager is sad, the regular customers are sad, I am pretending to be sad. But the one thing I'll never forget is the stories, the tales of Karens clawing their way up through the pits of hell, at night they fill my dreams asking if the chicken is gluten-free and demanding to speak to the manager. I don't think I'll ever run out of stories, or stop enjoying the look of horror spread over people's faces as I recite them for those who have enjoyed the luxury of never working in our sector. 

So without further creative ramble, here are the top complaints I've received from customers. Organized in a list, in no specific order because that sounded like too much work.  

&amp;#x200B;

1)  ""WHAT' A' 'E'' MEAN ''U CAN' GI'B ME BEER? GIMMIE A DRINK Y'A \*\*\*\*\* OR I'LL HAVE A WORD WI' YO'R MANAGER AND GIT Y' FIRED\*smug look\*"" 

Context: Fast food restaurant thought it was a good idea to serve beer. We were open 24/7 and stopped serving beer at 10pm, every weekend (or around any major sporting event) as the bars closed and the drunk zombies stumbled home they passed our sign, beaming like a lighthouse in an otherwise empty and dark street, a small tiny part of their brain we call ""the Nugget center"" would light up and a voice would start screaming ""Nuggets!"" in their ear. They stumble in through the front door, see the massive POS advert for our new branded beer and immediately come to the conclusion they could continue drinking here.

This was particularly bad when large groups of track suit wearing sluggers would swarm the place trying to convince me to keep serving them often with the wonderful phrase ""Show me the rule where it says I can't drink here?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

2) My Sushi is Cold!

Context: or ""My fish is Raw!!"" or ""Where is the meat? Why is it all rice??!"" or ""Why is it so small?"" kind of complaints you get from people who have no idea what sushi is and just want to try it because it's the office trend. Pretty confident anyone who's worked in a sushi place has had to deal with these idiots.

&amp;#x200B;

3) My **DISABLED** child said the food I ordered for my **DISABLED** child was cold, do you know how hard it is for me to have a **DISABLED** child and how disappointed my **DISABLED** child was when my **DISABLED** child ordered your food. Did I mention my child is **DISABLED**? 

Context: Take-out place, not exact words but roughly this was the context of their argument. Their food was cold, their child was disabled. She genuinely shouted the word disabled louder every time she said it, and she said it as every opportunity. She also had no child with her.

The best part? The receipt for her food was dated 7 months prior. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) ""Excuse me, I booked! Why am I not allowed to sit down?""

Context: the building was on fire. No I'm not making that up. A large neon sign had overheated and flames started erupting from it. The restaurant had been evacuated, four fire engines were parked outside, the alarm was still going off and the place was filled with smoke. The fire had been put out by this point and the GM had returned to the building to turn off the alarm while the Fire dept examined the sign. Enter stage left, woman in early 50's, stands by the 'please wait here to be seated sign', FF noticed her, wanders over and tells her the place is 'obviously closed'. She huffs and leaves, walks outside and pulls out her phone. She downloads the Restaurant app, makes a reservation for that day, then walks *back* into the restaurant which is still full of smoke, demands to see the manager and proclaims loudly that she has a reservation and the law requires we serve her.

She was not alone. Over the course of the next few hours, while we were still around, several more people would attempt to walk into the smokey, dark restaurant. A few laughed it off ""Oh guess I need better glasses then, ha ha"" and another demanded to know why we were closed, dragged my GM outside and tried to point to the opening times posted on the door ""See it's not 10pm yet, you *should* be open"".

&amp;#x200B;

5) ""The Ice in my water has watered down my water, I demand a free replacement""

and

6) ""What do you mean Your staff won't go to McDonalds for us? We PAID to be here!""

Context:  explained here [https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the\_night\_of\_the\_living\_vegans/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the_night_of_the_living_vegans/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 

But for tldr; I'll just say this. Vegan Influencers.

&amp;#x200B;

7) The customer demanded to free replacement on her cappuccino because ""it was too wet""

Context: I mean how do you respond to that? After biting down my tongue to resist the temptation to point out that coffee is a liquid which, historically, has always been wet. I get her to clarify, after a bit of back and forth, and with a lot of tutting, it turns out what she actually wants is a Babyccino, some weird drink made-up by upper-middle-class people to give to children who want to sit in on the ""fun"" of having coffee with Sharon from jazzercise class.

It's all foam, with some chocolate powder sprinkled over the top.

&amp;#x200B;

8)  Guy comes in, orders two cheeseburgers, two coffees, and a cake, hands me $5 and looks genuinely offended that it didn't cover the full cost. 

Context: He wasn't old enough for it to be a generational thing. But the look he gave me when I told him the price made me think he'd misheard me say something rude about his mother. He pulled out a 20, threw it on the counter then yanked his phone out of his pocket and made a show of calling his friend to complain about the over-priced restaurant he was in.

&amp;#x200B;

9) How to order a coffee in &lt;popular student cafe&gt;:

1) Wander aimlessly around the store for 10 minutes  
2) Stare at the menu for a further 10 minutes ignoring the man behind the till asking if you need assistance.  
3) Wait till the vendor starts serving someone else then glare at them.  
4) Order a coffee that wasn't on the menu, ask for it to be topped off with Yoghurt and crushed Almonds  
5) Stare in disbelief at the menu for another 10 minutes when informed the cafe cannot fulfill your request.  
6) Order a cappuccino  
7) Leave the counter and await coffee by standing in the middle of the shop with your arms folded.  
8) Wait till Vendor has prepared coffee, brought it to you and started to walk away.  
9) Ask for extra sugar, wait till vendor returns with sugar.  
10) demand a Take-out cup.  
11) Leave requested additional sugar on the table as you walk out. 

Also includes this wonderful transaction at the same location:

Them: Tea Please  
Me: how do you like it?  
Them: medium, please  
Me:...OK, sugar?  
Them: Yes  
Me: how many?  
Them: with milk, please.  
Me: alright so no sugar?  
Them: uhhh.....just medium, please. 

Speaking of which I really wish people waiting in line wouldn't jangle change and stare at me while I'm serving someone, what are they expecting me to drop everything I'm doing and run over to them and say ""Oh I'm sorry sir I wasn't aware you had MONEY how foolish of me to serve that other person first just because they came in and ordered before you, how cass of me I do apologize"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway

10) ""How can it possibly take you longer than 5 minutes to cook a full meal? \*I\* can do it at home in less time!""

Context: They had a lecture at 10am (and made sure I was well aware of that), came in around 9:40, sat down ordered coffee, then and 9:50am asked for two full breakfast meals sit-in.  
I explained that it would take at least 10 mins to cook both breakfasts and the extra coffee and they wouldn't have enough time to get to the lecture hall at 10 but they ordered regardless, paid then 5 mins later complained I was being too slow and ""now had to run"". 

They came back later and demanded a full explanation as to how it was not possible to cook a full breakfast meal in under 5 minutes, line by line with 'exact' cooking times specified.

&amp;#x200B;

11) \*In an attempt to prize open the door\* ""You're still in there, I can see you! that means you're open! Stop trying to be lazy and serve me!"" 

Or words to that effect, this was so long ago I can't honestly remember what he said, I only remember that boiled ham face with its weird cheesy grin as he attempted to destroy me with Facts and Logic. 

Now I've seen enough stories on this subreddit to know I am not alone when it comes to customers trying to force their way into empty, closed restaurants so I won't bore you with the details only that our door was on a motor, you turn the little key and the shutter comes down. 

While closing one night two hands appear under the shutter just before it hits the ground and an effort is made to push the shutter back up. Thinking this might be an emergency or something I raise the shutter only to be confronted by a man who rushes the door, glares at me and starts pounding on the glass demanding to be let in because he'd 'caught' us trying to close early.

We'd closed on time, some half-hour ago, pulling the shutter down was the last thing we did at night.

&amp;#x200B;

12) ""What do you mean you will not honor this deal made by the previous business?""

Context: The restaurant sat on property previously owned by a large chain restaurant. That restaurant had closed down nearly 12 years ago after moving to a different part of town, yet people still came waddling in with vouchers and coupons for that company expecting us, a very clearly different restaurant, to honor them. Some arguments got very heated and if I could tell you the name of that restaurant you could go look at the *hundreds* of 1-star yelp reviews complaining that we don't honor other restaurants coupon deals.   

&amp;#x200B;

and finally

&amp;#x200B;

13) ""What do you mean you're open Sunday? That is the LORDS day""

Yes, this did happen. We received a very long, yet very polite letter from a local priest questioning our decision to open Sundays and requesting we close that day in order to give the staff time to rest and pray as our Lord (in one religion) did when he created the world and threatened to preach to his pulpit to people not to come to the restaurant on Sundays. He also questioned a lot of other things that I won't mention in polite company but let's just say if you dyed your hair blue you were getting nasty looks from Agnus and the Sunday Squad.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's all I can think of for now.

Go away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hired, fired, re-hired, fired again, promoted, demoted, burned, scarred and have held &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; every position in a restaurant outside of General Manager, to which I am very grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 15 years I&amp;#39;ve finally bagged a non-services job, my last shift is Friday. Everyone at the place I currently work is sad, my manager is sad, the regular customers are sad, I am pretending to be sad. But the one thing I&amp;#39;ll never forget is the stories, the tales of Karens clawing their way up through the pits of hell, at night they fill my dreams asking if the chicken is gluten-free and demanding to speak to the manager. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever run out of stories, or stop enjoying the look of horror spread over people&amp;#39;s faces as I recite them for those who have enjoyed the luxury of never working in our sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further creative ramble, here are the top complaints I&amp;#39;ve received from customers. Organized in a list, in no specific order because that sounded like too much work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  &amp;quot;WHAT&amp;#39; A&amp;#39; &amp;#39;E&amp;#39;&amp;#39; MEAN &amp;#39;&amp;#39;U CAN&amp;#39; GI&amp;#39;B ME BEER? GIMMIE A DRINK Y&amp;#39;A ***** OR I&amp;#39;LL HAVE A WORD WI&amp;#39; YO&amp;#39;R MANAGER AND GIT Y&amp;#39; FIRED*smug look*&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: Fast food restaurant thought it was a good idea to serve beer. We were open 24/7 and stopped serving beer at 10pm, every weekend (or around any major sporting event) as the bars closed and the drunk zombies stumbled home they passed our sign, beaming like a lighthouse in an otherwise empty and dark street, a small tiny part of their brain we call &amp;quot;the Nugget center&amp;quot; would light up and a voice would start screaming &amp;quot;Nuggets!&amp;quot; in their ear. They stumble in through the front door, see the massive POS advert for our new branded beer and immediately come to the conclusion they could continue drinking here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was particularly bad when large groups of track suit wearing sluggers would swarm the place trying to convince me to keep serving them often with the wonderful phrase &amp;quot;Show me the rule where it says I can&amp;#39;t drink here?&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) My Sushi is Cold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: or &amp;quot;My fish is Raw!!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Where is the meat? Why is it all rice??!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Why is it so small?&amp;quot; kind of complaints you get from people who have no idea what sushi is and just want to try it because it&amp;#39;s the office trend. Pretty confident anyone who&amp;#39;s worked in a sushi place has had to deal with these idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) My &lt;strong&gt;DISABLED&lt;/strong&gt; child said the food I ordered for my &lt;strong&gt;DISABLED&lt;/strong&gt; child was cold, do you know how hard it is for me to have a &lt;strong&gt;DISABLED&lt;/strong&gt; child and how disappointed my &lt;strong&gt;DISABLED&lt;/strong&gt; child was when my &lt;strong&gt;DISABLED&lt;/strong&gt; child ordered your food. Did I mention my child is &lt;strong&gt;DISABLED&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: Take-out place, not exact words but roughly this was the context of their argument. Their food was cold, their child was disabled. She genuinely shouted the word disabled louder every time she said it, and she said it as every opportunity. She also had no child with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part? The receipt for her food was dated 7 months prior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &amp;quot;Excuse me, I booked! Why am I not allowed to sit down?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: the building was on fire. No I&amp;#39;m not making that up. A large neon sign had overheated and flames started erupting from it. The restaurant had been evacuated, four fire engines were parked outside, the alarm was still going off and the place was filled with smoke. The fire had been put out by this point and the GM had returned to the building to turn off the alarm while the Fire dept examined the sign. Enter stage left, woman in early 50&amp;#39;s, stands by the &amp;#39;please wait here to be seated sign&amp;#39;, FF noticed her, wanders over and tells her the place is &amp;#39;obviously closed&amp;#39;. She huffs and leaves, walks outside and pulls out her phone. She downloads the Restaurant app, makes a reservation for that day, then walks &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; into the restaurant which is still full of smoke, demands to see the manager and proclaims loudly that she has a reservation and the law requires we serve her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was not alone. Over the course of the next few hours, while we were still around, several more people would attempt to walk into the smokey, dark restaurant. A few laughed it off &amp;quot;Oh guess I need better glasses then, ha ha&amp;quot; and another demanded to know why we were closed, dragged my GM outside and tried to point to the opening times posted on the door &amp;quot;See it&amp;#39;s not 10pm yet, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be open&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &amp;quot;The Ice in my water has watered down my water, I demand a free replacement&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) &amp;quot;What do you mean Your staff won&amp;#39;t go to McDonalds for us? We PAID to be here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context:  explained here &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the_night_of_the_living_vegans/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the_night_of_the_living_vegans/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for tldr; I&amp;#39;ll just say this. Vegan Influencers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) The customer demanded to free replacement on her cappuccino because &amp;quot;it was too wet&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: I mean how do you respond to that? After biting down my tongue to resist the temptation to point out that coffee is a liquid which, historically, has always been wet. I get her to clarify, after a bit of back and forth, and with a lot of tutting, it turns out what she actually wants is a Babyccino, some weird drink made-up by upper-middle-class people to give to children who want to sit in on the &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; of having coffee with Sharon from jazzercise class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all foam, with some chocolate powder sprinkled over the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8)  Guy comes in, orders two cheeseburgers, two coffees, and a cake, hands me $5 and looks genuinely offended that it didn&amp;#39;t cover the full cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: He wasn&amp;#39;t old enough for it to be a generational thing. But the look he gave me when I told him the price made me think he&amp;#39;d misheard me say something rude about his mother. He pulled out a 20, threw it on the counter then yanked his phone out of his pocket and made a show of calling his friend to complain about the over-priced restaurant he was in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) How to order a coffee in &amp;lt;popular student cafe&amp;gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Wander aimlessly around the store for 10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;
2) Stare at the menu for a further 10 minutes ignoring the man behind the till asking if you need assistance.&lt;br/&gt;
3) Wait till the vendor starts serving someone else then glare at them.&lt;br/&gt;
4) Order a coffee that wasn&amp;#39;t on the menu, ask for it to be topped off with Yoghurt and crushed Almonds&lt;br/&gt;
5) Stare in disbelief at the menu for another 10 minutes when informed the cafe cannot fulfill your request.&lt;br/&gt;
6) Order a cappuccino&lt;br/&gt;
7) Leave the counter and await coffee by standing in the middle of the shop with your arms folded.&lt;br/&gt;
8) Wait till Vendor has prepared coffee, brought it to you and started to walk away.&lt;br/&gt;
9) Ask for extra sugar, wait till vendor returns with sugar.&lt;br/&gt;
10) demand a Take-out cup.&lt;br/&gt;
11) Leave requested additional sugar on the table as you walk out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also includes this wonderful transaction at the same location:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Them: Tea Please&lt;br/&gt;
Me: how do you like it?&lt;br/&gt;
Them: medium, please&lt;br/&gt;
Me:...OK, sugar?&lt;br/&gt;
Them: Yes&lt;br/&gt;
Me: how many?&lt;br/&gt;
Them: with milk, please.&lt;br/&gt;
Me: alright so no sugar?&lt;br/&gt;
Them: uhhh.....just medium, please. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which I really wish people waiting in line wouldn&amp;#39;t jangle change and stare at me while I&amp;#39;m serving someone, what are they expecting me to drop everything I&amp;#39;m doing and run over to them and say &amp;quot;Oh I&amp;#39;m sorry sir I wasn&amp;#39;t aware you had MONEY how foolish of me to serve that other person first just because they came in and ordered before you, how cass of me I do apologize&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) &amp;quot;How can it possibly take you longer than 5 minutes to cook a full meal? *I* can do it at home in less time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: They had a lecture at 10am (and made sure I was well aware of that), came in around 9:40, sat down ordered coffee, then and 9:50am asked for two full breakfast meals sit-in.&lt;br/&gt;
I explained that it would take at least 10 mins to cook both breakfasts and the extra coffee and they wouldn&amp;#39;t have enough time to get to the lecture hall at 10 but they ordered regardless, paid then 5 mins later complained I was being too slow and &amp;quot;now had to run&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They came back later and demanded a full explanation as to how it was not possible to cook a full breakfast meal in under 5 minutes, line by line with &amp;#39;exact&amp;#39; cooking times specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) *In an attempt to prize open the door* &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re still in there, I can see you! that means you&amp;#39;re open! Stop trying to be lazy and serve me!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or words to that effect, this was so long ago I can&amp;#39;t honestly remember what he said, I only remember that boiled ham face with its weird cheesy grin as he attempted to destroy me with Facts and Logic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve seen enough stories on this subreddit to know I am not alone when it comes to customers trying to force their way into empty, closed restaurants so I won&amp;#39;t bore you with the details only that our door was on a motor, you turn the little key and the shutter comes down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While closing one night two hands appear under the shutter just before it hits the ground and an effort is made to push the shutter back up. Thinking this might be an emergency or something I raise the shutter only to be confronted by a man who rushes the door, glares at me and starts pounding on the glass demanding to be let in because he&amp;#39;d &amp;#39;caught&amp;#39; us trying to close early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d closed on time, some half-hour ago, pulling the shutter down was the last thing we did at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) &amp;quot;What do you mean you will not honor this deal made by the previous business?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: The restaurant sat on property previously owned by a large chain restaurant. That restaurant had closed down nearly 12 years ago after moving to a different part of town, yet people still came waddling in with vouchers and coupons for that company expecting us, a very clearly different restaurant, to honor them. Some arguments got very heated and if I could tell you the name of that restaurant you could go look at the &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of 1-star yelp reviews complaining that we don&amp;#39;t honor other restaurants coupon deals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and finally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) &amp;quot;What do you mean you&amp;#39;re open Sunday? That is the LORDS day&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this did happen. We received a very long, yet very polite letter from a local priest questioning our decision to open Sundays and requesting we close that day in order to give the staff time to rest and pray as our Lord (in one religion) did when he created the world and threatened to preach to his pulpit to people not to come to the restaurant on Sundays. He also questioned a lot of other things that I won&amp;#39;t mention in polite company but let&amp;#39;s just say if you dyed your hair blue you were getting nasty looks from Agnus and the Sunday Squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s all I can think of for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and remember if you do go into a stylish Asian restaurant, don&amp;#39;t order the duck pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work 12 hour shifts at a 'high end' sandwich place which also serves fresh juices and smoothies. This tale just happened and I'm kinda still dumbfounded. 

A little back story- I fell on my leg and hurt it pretty badly last week. The pain felt unbearable on this day. I couldn't find anyone to take my shift so I just had to keep working.

This is the 9th hour of my workday and I was at the cashier when these two Ladies walk in and order with the numbers listed on the menu instead of the names. I take their order normally and went to help my coworkers. Their food is served and after a few moments they come by and say, they got the wrong drinks. They ordered smoothies, not juices. And I realised because of my preoccupation with pain I forgot to ask them if they wanted the juice or smoothie. 

Okay fair enough. I apologise and explain to them what happened and ask my coworker to make them the right order, no charge, and I go back to work. My other coworker asked me what happened and I also explain the mistake to her.

After their correct order was done the lady just all of a sudden bursted out like a chest monster- 'This is not the right way to treat customers', 'I come here everyday and this is not the right color of the drink' and 'I work in the service industry too and I would never treat my paying customers like this.'

At this point the whole restaurant is looking at this yelling lady. I limp over to see what's happening and she unleashes another word vomit cloud on me. As we keep asking what's the problem and how we can fix it she just keeps shouting at the top of her lungs 'you can't treat customers like this'. So to finish this I apologise to her again and go back to work.

She storms off and a minute later the other lady walks in and starts talking to the shift manager. Apparently when I explained to them my mistake I was talking very 'rudely'. And then I turned around and 'talked shit' about them to my coworker. And apparently my other coworker made their drinks wrong to spite them for some reason.

I'm sorry lady that you're so unhappy in life that you have to yell at service people because they didn't behave like sunshine is coming out of your ass. I'm still super confused as to what triggered this person so much. This place gets busy and we make hundreds of orders per day. Mistakes are bound to happen from both sides. But we always correct them. Literally no one has ever acted like this.

This tale just happened and I&amp;#39;m kinda still dumbfounded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little back story- I fell on my leg and hurt it pretty badly last week. The pain felt unbearable on this day. I couldn&amp;#39;t find anyone to take my shift so I just had to keep working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 9th hour of my workday and I was at the cashier when these two Ladies walk in and order with the numbers listed on the menu instead of the names. I take their order normally and went to help my coworkers. Their food is served and after a few moments they come by and say, they got the wrong drinks. They ordered smoothies, not juices. And I realised because of my preoccupation with pain I forgot to ask them if they wanted the juice or smoothie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay fair enough. I apologise and explain to them what happened and ask my coworker to make them the right order, no charge, and I go back to work. My other coworker asked me what happened and I also explain the mistake to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After their correct order was done the lady just all of a sudden bursted out like a chest monster- &amp;#39;This is not the right way to treat customers&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;I come here everyday and this is not the right color of the drink&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;I work in the service industry too and I would never treat my paying customers like this.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the whole restaurant is looking at this yelling lady. I limp over to see what&amp;#39;s happening and she unleashes another word vomit cloud on me. As we keep asking what&amp;#39;s the problem and how we can fix it she just keeps shouting at the top of her lungs &amp;#39;you can&amp;#39;t treat customers like this&amp;#39;. So to finish this I apologise to her again and go back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She storms off and a minute later the other lady walks in and starts talking to the shift manager. Apparently when I explained to them my mistake I was talking very &amp;#39;rudely&amp;#39;. And then I turned around and &amp;#39;talked shit&amp;#39; about them to my coworker. And apparently my other coworker made their drinks wrong to spite them for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry lady that you&amp;#39;re so unhappy in life that you have to yell at service people because they didn&amp;#39;t behave like sunshine is coming out of your ass. I&amp;#39;m still super confused as to what triggered this person so much. This place gets busy and we make hundreds of orders per day. Mistakes are bound to happen from both sides. But we always correct them. Literally no one has ever acted like this. &lt;/p&gt;

So there I was on an unassuming Sunday afternoon, mind full of hope and a naive attitude. I was only a smidge hungover from the night before but nothing was going to stop me from getting that bread today. I walked into work dick swinging in the breeze and tossed my jacket on a chair like the fucking Fonz. I decided to walk through the back of house with my sunglasses on so I could stunt of these cooks and server hoes. I relieved the morning bartender with a high five and began to get that sourdough. 

An hour or so into the shift things are going great, I’m working my tables and rocking my bar top like I’m Kanye at friends wedding. Needless to say I’m crushing it. Before I could even polish my pimp cup for my post shift buss down, in walks hell in a bad haircut. This woman looked like Peggy Bundy and Peggy Hill has a sister who was a total asshole. An Omega-level Karen. Like, if Magneto or fuckin Thanos just wanted to go in on a bartender this was the one.  I’m used to dealing wit these hoes so I go in like Drake at a high school prom. 

I wait what I call a required four minutes to go greet her and her dumb looking husband and she says, hey.....my dude....we ready. I’m like bet, this bout to be easy as hell. It wasn’t. 

*a bar ticket prints

Not only was this bitch not ready but she was so lost in the entire idea of people ordering food from a person in a place where people order food from a person. Mind you, I wasn’t super busy at the time but I would end up in so deep in the weeds I’d need a machete to find my way out. The following convo went like this:

*a bar ticket prints

Me: are we ready to order?
Custy: yes. And we are in a rush to get home to our dogs sooooooooo......
Me: no prob. What are we drinking?
C: I’d like a beer what do you have on tap?
Me 😑 standing in front of her while we are both literally 11inches away from the taps listing them all off. 

*a bar ticket prints

C: ya know what I’ll have a martini
M: what sorta vodka would you like?
C: I’d like a blackberry sangria

*a bar ticket prints

At this point two of my tables are giving me the ‘i would like my check’ wave

Me: ok the sangr-
C (while holding the drink menu in her hand) : actually what do you have for bottled beer?

*a bar ticket prints

I list off the beer list. 
The couple two seats down ask for refills 
The couple behind me ask for ketchup
The guy at the end of the bar points at his empty glass

*another fucking bar ticket prints

Me: so what are we thinking?
C: I’ll have a tall bud light
Me: ok. And for the husband?
H: a margarita

*another ticket prints how have we not run out of fucking paper yet!!!!!!!!

C: I’ll also have a margarita
Me: okely dokely you fucking terrorist

This took 6.38 minutes 

So I get their stupid drinks and food in and then I realize I have four checks to drop off and eventually cash out, what feels like 90 tickets and 137 drinks to make in the printer, 5 drinks to make on the bar top, one side of ketchup, two diet cokes I definently have to go out back for because this gun fucking sucks or whatever, this hoe over here needs ranch, dummy at 103 asks to change to some baseball game, I just got sat again and the bud light keg just kicked. Fml 

*another ticket prints

And then she sat there for two hours yelling at her husband and left mediocre tip. The end

,TalesFromYourServer,"Last night I worked a 14 top. They were all terrible people, douchiest people I have ever come in contact with. The royal family of Douchland. One guy sits down and orders a beer. He says, “Every time you come to the table I want you to have a beer for me.” I thought he was probably just joking, so I leave and come back and he says, “Where is my beer? Did you really forget what I told you like 2 minutes ago? Wow.” So I said, “OH! I am so sorry it won’t happen again.” So, for the next 2 hours, no matter what. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I approached the table I left a beer. After about
45 minutes the  beer began to pile up. A friend of King Doucherbottom tried to take one that I put down, but I grabbed it and said, “Sorry sir, this is your friends beer I would be happy to get one for you if you like.” Long story short he ended up buying 25 beers at 8 dollars a pop with a 20% mandatory auto-grat on the table. He maybe drank 4. I have never felt so good in my life. It doesn’t pay to be an arrogant ass folks!

EDIT: Man, thanks everyone! This was a crowning achievement in my 7 years of serving. I work at a place where some people come in and treat me like a piece of stew meat, and I have learned to play the game in order to make money. I love my job and the people I meet, but I get stepped on a lot. Its nice to win one and have you guys appreciate it.

EDIT AGAIN: This is incredibly humbling. I knew it was a good Server Tale, but thank you guys! I don’t post much on anything ever, so this means so much that you guys liked what I did. 

To answer some questions: They split the bill seven ways. They did not even look at the charges. I put down the bill and the cards went on top. Their total bill was about 1200 everything included, beer, food, and all. This not common at a 14 top where I work, but not surprising. I came out making around 240 before tip out. 

I work at an independent fine dining italian restaurant outside of Chicago. 

Every time I put a beer down he said nothing. If he would have acknowledged my presence and told me to stop I would have. He said nothing. I started to feel bad, for a couple minutes,  and then he yelled at me like a dog to get the food out faster.  THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED. I just want to reiterate that. HE ASKED FOR IT. Also, I was watching him drink. If at any point his behavior/ consumption increased I would have stopped. He walked out the exact same way he walked in. Like a doucher. 

The beer was SURROUNDING HIS SEATING AREA. Just bottles and bottles and bottles. It was incredible. 

I make my own drinks where I work, as we don’t have a typical bar, just a large server station. No bar tender was involved.

I cannot deny the illegality of it, but I do not regret it!

The BOH and bussers enjoyed the undisturbed beers. I felt so good bringing them back in a bus tub of ice. It was like seeing the excitement of children on Christmas morning.

,TalesFromYourServer,"A recent story in here reminded me of an asshole I had at one of my very first customer service jobs... 

I was working my first shift as a manager at a very famous sandwich shop that used to have a pedophile as their mascot. That's not an import detail, but I hated that guy from the day his mug showed up on our cups... 

My store was in a tiny little town about an hour south of Pittsburgh. The biggest event of the summer was taking place - the carnival - and it was happening right outside our back door. Our evenings were full of drunk people, annoying kids and bags of forgotten goldfish.

Yet, it was Friday morning when we got our worst customer.

What walked in our door could be described as 'human' but only in the loosest possible terms. He shambled. He didn't make eye contact. He was dirty. He was very clearly still on the drunk side of hungover... he was a traveling carney man.

I don't mean to insult carnies as a whole. My childhood best friend is a carney and one of the hardest working people I've ever met... the guy in my sandwich shop was quite clearly the genesis if the carnie stereotype.

I was standing behind the glass with a co-worker when the carnie stumbled up to the glass and said that he wanted a sub.

""What kind of sub sir?""
""I don't care.""
""Well would you like an Italian or stea...""
""I don't fucking care!!!""

We decided on a steak sub, double meat, double cheese.

""OK sir, how about veggies?""
""What?""
""What veggies would you like on your sub?""
""All of them!""

Lettuce, onions, tomato, black olives, yellow peppers, jalapeños (we carried them), green peppers, cucumbers, pickles...

""What would you like for a dressing?""
""What?!""
""Italian? Mayon...""
""Can't you fuckin hear? Put it all on there!!! Fuck!!!""

Italian, oil &amp; vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup (don't ask), salt &amp; pepper, Italian seasoning... oh and (I remembered we had seasonal item sauces in the walk-in) gyro sauce and tartar sauce from lent, the year before.

""For here or to go?""

""Here!""
""That'll be $12.73"" (or whatever a double meat/cheese 11 inch sub costs) 

It was the largest, sloppiest, nastiest sub we had ever created. By the time he got it unwrapped the bread had turned to mush and the fillings slopped out on the wrapper. He proceeded to eat it fistfull by fistfull. 

We watched in horror and awe. 

He finished it, and just as I was starting to feel guilt over being part of ruining this guy's day, he stands up, cleans up his table and thanks us for the best damn sub he has ever had.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hi all, I'm new to this sub but I've been waiting/bartending on and off (mostly on) for almost 30 years.  

I believe I have achieved burn out.

I can't stand it anymore.  I'm making stupid mistakes when I'm ringing in orders, and I know I'm better than that.  I think my brain is like ""cut this shit out!""  And it's not customers, most of them are just fine.  It's not my managers or my co-workers or the place I work.  I've worked with enough good and bad managers and co-workers that most of what happens I don't even notice anymore.  I've worked in enough good and bad places to know that where I work now is okay. It's not them, it's me.

I recently got a second job hosting part-time at a place down the street.  Why don't I just take more serving shifts?  Because I can't bring myself to do it. So I told my training manager at my present job that I had gotten a second job hosting, and that I might need to tweak my schedule just a little.  He was cool about it, but was like, you know we need hosts here, right?  No, I didn't know that. So he told me I could host 10-15 hours a week there, and serve three days a week if I want.  At my new second job, I could get more hours with that, plus tips on top of my wage.

Here's my idea:  keep both hosting jobs, and have my manager take me off serving completely.  

I know I'd have to work more both places, possibly 40-50 between the two, but...I kind of see this as my way out of serving, without having to job-hop and hit that weird spot with a new job where you don't have any money coming in for 2 to 3 weeks.

I'm almost afraid to bring this idea up to management, but I think now would be the time to do it, as they have hired a few more servers for the upcoming season, including hosts that they are also training to serve.

Definitely one of those days I'm gonna look back on as just being disappointed with humanity, but yeah. I worked the entire day, was going into the tenth hour of my shift, when I got sat with this table. They were already an issue in the lobby, when the mom screamed at her child for touching her dress, and the dad threw a fit over a ten minute wait bc he ""had children to feed"". 

Couldn't give them our starting appetizer bc they hadn't put in their entree orders, and later when they complained about me that turned into me ""pre-judging them by their appearance"". 

One child's meal came out five minutes after the rest. I assured them that I had put a 911 on it, it was on its way, I was so sorry abt that. That turned into me being ""dismissive and having a poor attitude"". 

Reminded the mother of a check that she got after the regular meal, one for three desserts that she never had any intention to pay for. She cut me off, refused to look at me and threw her hand up, telling me she would get to it. I said ""Okay. Sorry."" Backed off. That turned into me being ""in her ear"". (I was a foot away, but at this point she was too far gone to care). 

They complained that I was ""mean-mugging"" them while they complained. I wasn't ever looking at them- the closest I got was existing nearby for a couple moments, but I very firmly did not want to look at them. Honestly, I can't say the same for every other server there- it was me looking away and five of my coworkers just staring them down. I assume they were too drunk to care that it wasn't me. 


All throughout this, I kept wondering why they were getting worse when I kept going back. The dad  only had two drinks, and a ton of pasta. The mom was drinking tea. Couldn't figure out why they were getting so aggressive and loud about how much they didn't like me when I was getting everything I could for them. Found out later from the hosts that the mom had been wandering outside a couple times while they were there to drink out of a flask. 

They wrote me a letter basically telling me I wasnt charming or smiling enough while they berated me and made fun of me to all of my coworkers, and that I wasn't going to get the $100 bill they brought in for me (???). Claimed to be servers,  but a lot of how they acted about things like wait time or appetizers implies otherwise.

They were already an issue in the lobby, when the mom screamed at her child for touching her dress, and the dad threw a fit over a ten minute wait bc he &amp;quot;had children to feed&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Let me start out by saying thank you for your service but your daughters are idiots.

“Okay guys order whatever you want dinner’s on me”

I look at the table set for 10 but only 5 a child and a baby are seated before me? Apparently they told the host there were 8 so they could get more room to themselves. 

So start off with drinks aside from the bar being backed up everything goes well. Then they start to order. Dad knows what he wants right away and I like him he’s a chill mother fucker. And it’s so nice he wants to pay for everyone. 

I get to the son (adult son) who has a medical condition so we try to find what he can eat within his means. Finally get to the daughters (also adults one with a baby). Firstly they’re throwing Cheerios at the baby making this huge mess. Secondly one had a really bad dye job with her hair and trust me, that’s a huge red flag in my area for how people will treat you. 

“Finally you’re over here”

“Sorry I was trying to help him find something he can eat”

Man stays quiet.

“Well I have questions” okay get through all that bring out their appetizers “we want more chips!” Literally as Im putting the plate of chips and dip on the table. Okay? Sure it’s not that busy and it’s not like the kitchen will know. 

I go check on my other tables because somehow I end up with seven other tables on top of this “party.” I come back and immediately the girl with the bad dye job “drinks!” Her little girl looks at mom and says “please” thank you little girl teach those manners. 

Come back with my hands full of drinks “where are the chips!?”

“I’m sorry there were no more trays so I was going to bring these and come straight back” 

“Whatever just bring me another sweet tea” again I’m literally setting down her drink in front of her.

Come back with the chips “bring us more!” GODDAMMIT YOURE NOT MY ONLY TABLE STOP ASKING FOR CHIPS WHEN YOU HAVENT EVEN EATEN THE FIRST BATCH

“I’ll be right back with those”

Food comes out and there’s a ton of problems. “This is cold!” Manger stuck his finger in it, it wasn’t we made a new order. “My steak is rare” dye job complains, it says on the menu it comes rare unless otherwise specified, she did not specify. “There’s tomatoes on my food!” They’re peppers they’re very obviously peppers...

“I think they’re peppers” 

“They’re tomatoes take it back!”

I take it back the cook tells me they’re peppers I tell the manager about the idiot girls. I go back and tell them I’m about to have a manager come up and girls get excited “oh good! That’s great news!” Their dad on the other hand sits there like wtf? 

As I’m leaving he tells them to “leave that poor server alone” god bless him... for now. 

Manger takes care of everything I come to do a follow up “where’s the chips!” GOD WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO AND FUCKING CHIPS! I nod say I wasn’t told anything about chips but I’ll get them out right now. Come back with the chips ask about dessert thank god they’re full aside from the goddamn chips. Bring some boxes and the check. Dad pays in cash I give him his change he counts out a tip and leaves it on the table.

I usually wait until the table leaves because it’s rude just to grab it, unless of course they hand it to me. I should have grabbed it because when they were leaving I was looking around the table for the tip and it was gone. Dye job and the sister were laughing and still in hearing range “she’s looking for a tip” I’m pretty sure they took it...

I just about started crying and went to go check on my tables. I did have a couple tears run down at one table and I made those poor people feel so awkward but they couldn’t stand that party of white trash either. 

One table though, they saw the bullshit I was put through and gave me 25$ I didn’t see it until later though because they wrapped the 20$ in a 5$

Secondly one had a really bad dye job with her hair and trust me, that’s a huge red flag in my area for how people will treat you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Finally you’re over here”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sorry I was trying to help him find something he can eat”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man stays quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well I have questions” okay get through all that bring out their appetizers “we want more chips!” Literally as Im putting the plate of chips and dip on the table. Okay? Sure it’s not that busy and it’s not like the kitchen will know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go check on my other tables because somehow I end up with seven other tables on top of this “party.” I come back and immediately the girl with the bad dye job “drinks!” Her little girl looks at mom and says “please” thank you little girl teach those manners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come back with my hands full of drinks “where are the chips!?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry there were no more trays so I was going to bring these and come straight back” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever just bring me another sweet tea” again I’m literally setting down her drink in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come back with the chips “bring us more!” GODDAMMIT YOURE NOT MY ONLY TABLE STOP ASKING FOR CHIPS WHEN YOU HAVENT EVEN EATEN THE FIRST BATCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be right back with those”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food comes out and there’s a ton of problems. “This is cold!” Manger stuck his finger in it, it wasn’t we made a new order. “My steak is rare” dye job complains, it says on the menu it comes rare unless otherwise specified, she did not specify. “There’s tomatoes on my food!” They’re peppers they’re very obviously peppers...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think they’re peppers” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re tomatoes take it back!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take it back the cook tells me they’re peppers I tell the manager about the idiot girls. I go back and tell them I’m about to have a manager come up and girls get excited “oh good! That’s great news!” Their dad on the other hand sits there like wtf? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m leaving he tells them to “leave that poor server alone” god bless him... for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manger takes care of everything I come to do a follow up “where’s the chips!” GOD WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO AND FUCKING CHIPS! I nod say I wasn’t told anything about chips but I’ll get them out right now. Come back with the chips ask about dessert thank god they’re full aside from the goddamn chips. Bring some boxes and the check. Dad pays in cash I give him his change he counts out a tip and leaves it on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually wait until the table leaves because it’s rude just to grab it, unless of course they hand it to me. I should have grabbed it because when they were leaving I was looking around the table for the tip and it was gone. Dye job and the sister were laughing and still in hearing range “she’s looking for a tip” I’m pretty sure they took it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just about started crying and went to go check on my tables. I did have a couple tears run down at one table and I made those poor people feel so awkward but they couldn’t stand that party of white trash either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One table though, they saw the bullshit I was put through and gave me 25$ I didn’t see it until later though because they wrapped the 20$ in a 5$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So had a party of 10 actually 6 run me crazy for chips try to get things off their meal they weren’t even paying for comped steal my tip only for table with a mudslide to save my sanity&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"On the phone, please excuse any mistakes.

tl;dr: New guy comes with regulars and orders more drinks than he can finish. Wants to take leftover drink to go but we don't allow that. Gets angry, throws drink at my manager, coworker takes him down and cops take him. 

So the other night, I had two regulars come in. Most of the time we have no issues, they sit, drink, and play our slots and we have a mutual understanding. I don't expect tips, they don't expect anything special besides refills when asked for.

Of course, this had to change with Young Asshole (YA)

The two regulars bring YA to our place, quietly chatting and complimenting us. YA acted like he had something to prove to the entire restaurant so of course not only does he get our biggest drink order, he gets two. 

Two hours go by and they've all lost their budget on the slot machines so they just sit and chat while sipping. YA had to beg his friends to help him drink and even then they still had about half a bowl left.

At this point, YA asks for a container to take his drink to go. Now I know some other local places allow this but we're not licensed to do takeouts nor will we ever take that risk. We politely decline and tell him that we don't mind him taking his time to finish his drink.

YA gets belligerent. Launches into a spiel about how he's owed a certain service and that he paid good money on slots so he should be given a container. We still refuse because at this point he's slurring his words and that's already a red flag. 

I turn my back and this guy had the audacity to sneak into our employee work area and take one of our empty tip jars and pour his drink in there after dumping the coins out onto the floor.

At this point we're tired of him and firmly tell him and his friends to leave. The two regulars look non-plussed like this is normal and pay for their share and leave. YA is still holding our tip jar full of cocktail and we're not letting him leave with it. He decides this means he doesn't have to pay this bill and when we threaten to call the cops, he throws the container at my manager. 

At this point my coworker reacts and puts him on the ground in an arm bar. He's crying and screaming the whole time it takes the cops to arrive and take him off our hands.

**BACKSTORY**: 
i started a new job recently. before that, there was a BOH employee we will call Jim. i was nice to Jim (like i am to everyone, not extra nice) and we became friends. at the time he’s working with me, i have a commute of about 2 hours to/from work. one night he offers to take me home (read: insist). i was grateful and i venmo’d Jim gas money even though he told me not to.

later that night, Jim’s girlfriend Betty message me on instagram and asks me where is Jim. i just said probably on his way back to home, but she was angry with me because she is tracking his phone and i guess he said he’s with me, but not that he’s taking me home (idk/idc). i apologize to her because just keeping the peace lol. 

fast forward a few weeks. Jim asks me if i can hang out after work for a bit. i tell him to make sure Betty is okay with it first because i don’t want any drama. he tells me about 15 min later she’s okay. so we’re talking about some personal things, like he end up crying and i’m trying to comfort him. suddenly he asks if i would ever date him. (🤢😒🤢🤭😐no.) so i just get an uber home and that’s it. 


NEXT DAY, i come to work and Betty is now a BOH employee. I’m indifferent because idk her at all, but she is so cold to me right away. i was told to train her but she refuses to do any work i ask her. i baked cookies for every coworker and she threw the tray away. so i’m annoyed, but i didn’t do anything. i will not have drama at work, so i’m working and ignoring her. then the kitchen staff starts ASKING ME WHY I SLEPT WITH JIM WHEN I KNOW HE HAS GIRLFRIEND.


long story short, Jim and Betty are hard to work with and get let go. i think it’s the end. i start training for my new job a few months later, and one day, Betty leaves a negative review about me that makes no sense but kinda frustrating. i block them on social media and keep going. i really love my job.

**!end of backstory here!**


now today. My job opened a new location recently. i come in today and BETTY + JIM BOTH WORKING AT THE SAME STORE AS ME. two things: 1- the other location is closer to their living than now. 2- they obviously know i work there since they stalked me before to the other location.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work at a hotel bar. A group of three came in early-ish in the evening and I got a vibe that they weren’t the going to tip well right from the start. I’ve served folks that carried themselves in similar fashions who didn’t, but, I’m open to being surprised! 

One of the guys is celebrating his birthday! They’re chatty and kind of fun so I think okay, I can snag a coupon from the front desk and let him have a mixed drink on the house for his special night. His girlfriend orders a holy water and we joke about being basic bitches, we’re having a good time so far! 

They order a few shots and more mixed drinks and beer, eventually the bill is just shy of $110. The third fella, who seems to be third-wheeling it for his buddy’s birthday, asks what the bill is and brings out his wallet. Puts $120 in cash down, I grab him his change, and his pals get up and leave. One fella at the bar asks, “Did they leave you anything?” 
I still have a smile on my face. “No, and I could’ve made a lot of money had I bet on it too.”

Half a hour later they come back down for a smoke and birthday boy orders some drinks for the room. We get talking while I’m whipping them up and turns out he’s from my neck of the woods on the other side of the country! We reminisce about the mountains and the mild winters, smiles all around. He pays for his bill in cash, takes the change I got him and puts it in his pocket and once again walks away. I’m still smiling. The guy at the bar is shocked that I am not fuming. Eh, the hourly pays my rent, but the night is not off the a very great start, mentally I have already thrown in the towel. 

Some time goes by and a bunch of friends come by the bar. Whiskey and ginger ale are flowing, 3 rounds of tequila, caesars and beer galore. I’m happy to be busy, I wasn’t expecting it on a Saturday (they’re quite hit or miss), but I’m getting into the groove and doing my best to chat and entertain while making drink after shot after drink. They all pay up and tip accordingly, some $1/drink, others just hit 15% on the machine, but I don’t think the night can really be salvaged despite the slight change in mood. 

Most file out apart from two from the busy group, they’re enjoying my caesars and my company. We talk about life and vacations and music and even politics, they invite me to their nearby cabin this summer and insist they buy me a shot tonight. It’s getting late and I’m tired but these folks truly are splendid, they settle up and add an extra 20% to the total, she leaves and few coins in exchange for limes for the tequila they have in their room, and then the husband asks for one more drink to bring upstairs. 

One more ounce of whiskey and I give him a can of ginger ale for the road. Credit machine in hand, he types in the gratuity, shows the wife and she nods with a quick thumbs up, and presses “OK”. A receipt with a $50 tip, for one drink, prints in front of my eyes almost as if it were in slow motion. The tears are welling, and I barely manage a thank you before he says “this is one of the best experiences I’ve had at a bar, and you’re the bartender that made that possible.”

,TalesFromYourServer,"Tldr at the end. 

I was out of the industry for about 10 years while working in the bike industry. Got out of that at the end of a season because big corporations ruined it for me.

So it was November and I needed a job to cover bills until I figured out what I wanted to do. Applied at a locally-owned pizza joint. Either BOH or FOH. I just needed a job. They had a great reputation for excellent staff treatment. Their online application had photos of staff trips and parties. Specifically closing up for several days to take the entire staff on outings. The website also said that if you were called for an interview then you pretty much guaranteed a position. 

 They called me in for an interview I was psyched. But when I arrived they informed me that it was a group interview. Jammed six prospects into a semicircle booth and two hippy type women pinned us in with their chairs. 

They started by saying that there ""weren't any positions open"" but if they found one of us a perfect fit they'd find a position. The rest would receive letters saying letting us know that a position would be opening if we were still available. But all of us were predetermined to be on the hire list or we wouldn't be here today. We all had great references and some had even worked there before. I get wanting to get to know potential staff before you offer them a job but then the questions begin. 

At first it was just industry related stuff addressed to separate individuals. Like asking me what I'd do about a complaint, then asking the next person a different how would they handle food allergies. 

But then... 

They asked us all why manhole covers were round and asked each of us the same question. Not that it's relevant but there's only one answer. Why are school busses yellow? After someone says it's to increase visibility what other answer is there? Because they taste like bananas? 

Then the start asking each of us what would we do if the lettuce was spoiled and the kitchen didn't have anymore? So one person answers that they'd change the special board to reflect that we were out of lettuce, the next would say call the produce supplier and request a delivery, and maybe the next answer was to run to the grocery store, but how many answers can you expect to a list of judement based questions? Then they'd ""grade"" the answers and berate you if they didn't like the answer IN FRONT OF OTHER POTENTIAL HIRES. 

""Amy that was an excellent answer but it was the same as Frankie's, we are expecting you to have original solutions, and Dani that wasn't an acceptable solution. We couldn't spare the staff in the middle of lunch to do what you suggested. Have you never worked in a busy restaurant?""

By the time 5 people had answered the 6th was just grasping at straws. I could see one young girl was on the verge of tears. I can still remember the downcast look on her face after not knowing about a fucking manhole cover. I was fed up. I told the interviewers to let me out. 

""The interview isn't over and we expect each of you to complete the process.""

I said this interview and process was over for me. To pit me against other potential coworkers, to embarrass people who were the last picked to answer questions that the first person had already answered perfectly. No fucking way am I going to work for you. 

I left and one other person followed me. We talked a minute in the parking lot and she said she was about to walk too when I spoke up. 

Several weeks later I received a handwritten letter that was OVERNIGHTED to me. All sweet talk of how after much consideration it was determined that I wasn't right for the team. Blah blah blah. 

But I shit you not, this letter was overnighted to arrive on Christmas Eve! They paid $17 to try and ruin my Christmas. 

 Fuckers. 

I had a friend that worked there between semesters that the fantastic owner had basically retired and left these two in charge. The business had faltered and the owner sold it instead of coming back. 

He said everyone was promised retainment, but the two interviewing managers had caused them so much grief that they were both let go within months. 

Tldr: I applied at a cool place only to find the owners had split and left new age idiots to run the place into the ground by pitting workers against each other before they were hired.

I have been working at this job almost a month, there’s one POS terminal and at the end of the night a few nights ago I forgot to clock out because my coworker was counting the register and I just left. When I came in today, I went to clock in and it said I had to clock out— my manager looks me dead in the eyes and says to me, “if you forget to clock out again, you won’t get paid.”

Excuse me?? I’m a pre-law student married to a lawyer and so I did a little research just to make sure, but you can imagine that doing this would be totally illegal. Even if it’s not, I don’t take kindly to threats about my fucking money.

My coworker forgot to ring in a couple of glasses of soda, nothing that is coming out of budget (I personally ring in drinks immediately before serving them), and the manager makes him pay out of pocket for them... which is illegal, because you need written consent without threat of wages (deducting hours, removing from schedule, termination, etc.) to deduct wages for things like this in my state, it’s stated on the page regarding labor laws/worker’s rights/licensing and regulatory affairs.

To conclude, I learned my training was over today and at the end of the shift, got tipped out. For 5 hours I worked and made $7.40/hr., which is super below my state minimum wage and I had no idea I was done training. 

The manager has an enormous stick in their ass and scolded me for not preparing something on the floor (is this normal because gross), but with the cumulation of these things, you can only imagine what will happen if I stick around. I’m already quitting and not even about to see the shady things going on. I really was hoping this was the right spot to hone my skills, but I don’t need people threatening me and I will not stick with shady business practices.

EDIT: I don’t know what’s up with some folks being upset because I’m personally not taking action against this place with only my word of mouth to take them down. Please unclench your assholes, you’d think there’d be more outrage that there are people running business like this in the first place.

Serious allegations with things like sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace have a specific burden of proof, and I’d imagine that accusing someone of threatening my wages would be the same deal. I don’t have any evidence. There’s other factors as to why I’d rather not mix myself up in some kind of situation with these people but I don’t need to justify that.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This happened a couple weeks ago.
I was serving at a carnival event and I was having one of those off days where I just wasn’t good at my job. The day started with me oversleeping and arriving late to work. Luckily there wasn’t much to do during the time I wasn’t there, so my boss wasn’t mad at me, shit happens and I’m usually a reliable employee.

The first customer I served, I managed to drop a beer all over the table. Great, now I can reset the table while all the guests are arriving at once and want their drinks. Shortly after, I expertly spilled about 10 beers all over myself. This day just keeps getting better. After cleaning myself and everything else up, I go into the break room to take a couple of deep breaths. I accept this just isn’t my day and my aim for the day was to just get through it without any more major mishaps.

However, I am still slightly rattled and a couple of minor mishaps do happen. Fortunately the guests were all drunk, having a good time and weren’t being dicks towards me, even though I was being far from a good server. They did banter me though, as drunk people do. I enjoy banter, even on my worst day, so I appreciated it. Much preferred to an annoyed Karen.

One guest decided to take the banter to the next level. While clearing the tables, one of the bottles fell over on my tray. The guest took the tray off me and wanted to “show me how it’s done “.

,TalesFromYourServer,"First of, if this sounds kinda weird it's because the conversation wasn't in English and I don't know if I got the totally right translation for everything. 

So I work in the service area of a theater. There are a couple of stories I could tell but this particular one happened just a couple days ago and was really weird. I never had this in the year and a half I'm working here.

Yesterday I was at one of the bars. Right next to each other we have 3 sort of booths where each of us has their own set amount of drinks, snacks and their own till. I was at the very end of the bar, right next to the doors of the auditorium.

Shortly before the break started, a man sauntered out of the auditorium, went to my booth, slapped the counter and demanded an employee beer. At first I didn't even get what he wanted and said that we only have normal beer. He insisted on an employee beer. After looking at him more closely, my inner alarm went off and I asked for an ID that confirmed he worked with our company. 

For context, we do have special prices for employees, usually about half of what guests pay. But you usually recognize employees. If they are part of the cast and crew of the production we are hosting, they usually wear a badge that tells us they are cast and crew. Other people we recognize by their uniform and colleagues we recognize by face because we work directly with them. Not only did this man not tick any of those boxes, he also reeked of alcohol.

Back to the story: After I asked him for his ID he told me he didn't need to show one because after all he helped build the stage set. When I doubled down because I didn't know him and needed to see that ID he got condescending, proceeded to mock search his pockets all the while saying he didn't need to show me and to just sell me that beer. I didn't back down and the discussion ended with him wanting to speak my boss.

My shift supervisor was just a couple meters away because she was waiting for the doors to open so she could turn the music back on. She had followed the whole conversation and immediately announced her presence. The man went to her and started the same discussion with her. She only told him the same thing that I did. He even mentioned working for a company I never heard of before and got further angry when she told him that this wasn't the correct company.

At that moment the doors opened and a lot of people came into our area. The man sort of waved her off angrily and vanished into the crowd.

Later I heard that he told another coworker at the same bar just two booths down the same thing. And he got away with it because the coworker was new and didn't think anything weird about it. He just asked another coworker which price employees pay and off that man went. The nerve!

,TalesFromYourServer,"Foreign travelers are always a great source of hilarity and a nice opportunity to show off how friendly Americans can be, and boy do I get a lot of them. In my experience they‘re often some of the happiest customers because they’re excited by the bright lights of a new city destination and enjoying their overseas vacation. The hilarity comes from trying to cross language and cultural barriers that when combined make the whole interaction a little like two babies playing together. I don’t get you, you don’t get me, we’re still having a good time.

For example, twice last night I had the exchange of “How are we doing tonight?”

“Um...Pepsi?”

Cool, I’m doing pretty Pepsi myself.

The main thing these interactions involve is a LOT of pointing. I ask “Would you like another beer?” and point to the empty pint. They only order things with pictures so they can just point to the picture. They want to order a soda and I flip them to the right page and point to the list of brand names they’ll recognize. Barely any English? No big deal, we’re doing this whole thing pre-k style.

I keep my questions VERY simple to avoid confusion. When “Would everyone like water?” gets blank stares I just say “Water? Yes?” and they get me. When I know that’s the level I stick to pointing and “Good?” or “More?” or “Finished?” They give me a big smile and declare “Yes! Finished!” and we’ve understood each other. I always start with the assumption that they speak fluent English and dial it back until communication is achieved.

A lot of times the kids are better than the parents and we have a little translation moment. Out of respect I always make eye contact with the parent and speak directly to them, but when their teenager steps up like a pro it makes my job easy. Love those kids, little bilingual rockstars.

Then at the end of the meal they have to try and figure out tipping. Some of them are experienced at it and have no issues. Some of them will just hand over their card say a number like “80” and I have to run their card for the actual check amount and then show them the tip line. Some of them get that part but can’t read that they need to sign it. It’s a little adventure, but I like getting to show them so now they can eat at American restaurants and know exactly how to do it like the cosmopolitan world travelers they are. 

At the end of the day I know it’s scary to try and go out in a country where you don’t really know the language. It can be embarrassing to have to speak in very simple terms because that’s all you know. My job as a server to guests from around the globe is to make the experience as fun and easy as possible, and I know I’ve succeeded when it’s all smiles when the check comes.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Honestly, this is more of a rant/vent than anything. It got kind of long lol but if you read the whole thing, please let me know if you think I’m being unreasonable or if I should just find somewhere else to work. 

I work at a local chain restaurant. If I was getting more hours it would be an okay job, however after Christmas they slashed my hours from around 20 a week to 8-10. And they keep sending me home early, so I’m actually getting even less than that. At first I obviously thought I was doing something wrong, but I’ve heard other servers complaining about hours and managers talking about how they have to cut labor costs (in my state servers make the state minimum wage + tips). 

Most managers will tell me I’m cut, sometimes a little early but never more than an hour, and let me finish out my last tables. One of my managers starts telling me I’m done sometimes more than two hours before my shift is supposed to end. This is especially ridiculous now that I’m only getting scheduled 4-5 hour shifts twice a week. It feels pointless to even go to work for two hours and walk out with $20. He makes me transfer my last table or two to someone else, regardless of what stage the table is at in their meal. I’ve expressed mild irritation at this before, but haven’t wanted to push it since I’m the “new girl” -I’ve been here 6ish months in comparison to everyone else’s 2+ years. 

Last week I finally just refused to leave until my last table was done. My manager cut me two hours early, when another server showed up. He told me to transfer the table I just started to the new server. Okay, whatever. All I had done was order their drinks. Fine. But then he started bugging me about my only other table. It was a four top whose bill was over $100, so it was probably going to be a $10-20 tip. They were halfway through eating their meal and had already mentioned wanting dessert and coffee afterwards. I was just like... no, I’m not transferring them. I’ve done all the work. He kept telling me it was ridiculous to stand around for one table (even though I was cleaning, doing dishes, etc. staying busy). Finally I ended up having to kind of rush my table to finish and pay out so I could leave and still get their tip, which I think was a little lower than it would have been if I hadn’t done that and I don’t blame them. 

I think it looks tacky to switch servers halfway through without a legit reason. I’m also frustrated that I’m barely working, barely scraping by, and now I’m having to fight to keep tables that I did all the work for. Is this normal?? I moved here from a state where I only made $4/hour (but I was making a *lot* more in tips) so no one really cared if you hung out for a bit to wait for your last customers to leave. In fact you got in trouble if you left without cleaning and bussing your entire section. Am I wrong for thinking this is bullshit? It’s only one or two tables a night and wouldn’t be that big of a deal, but with my hours being cut on top of this I’m seriously not making any money anymore.

To sum it up, I had a new co-worker condescending me and micromanaging me on her second day.

Here's an update on this situation.

She came in today and it was the second time I've worked with her.

She came over while I was with a customer and asked me in that condescending tone, ""So how long have you *Really* been working here?""

I had enough of her acting like this. So I turned and faced her. I looked her right in the eyes and stood tall and said firmly but politely,

""I've been working here for 2 years.""

She seemed to shrink back as she realized that I wasn't some high school child here to get credit for school. I was a 20 year old woman who had been working her butt off.

""Oh."" She said quietly and went to go do dishes.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’m not looking forward into going to work tonight because I know a certain coworker is also scheduled. I initially liked her a lot when I was first hired, she seemed to take the job seriously. She seems to think of herself as “head server” and often touts about having seniority over everyone. The restaurant we work at hasn’t even been open a full year yet. None of us has seniority. That’s a little annoying, but I can brush it off. 


Things started coming to a head about a month ago. Another coworker and I were cut, so it was time to roll silverware. There were guests sitting at the table servers are “allowed” to roll at, and the table in BOH that we sometimes use to roll was being used for food prep. So we set up camp at a server station, another popular area to do side work at. This station also has a POS computer. The restaurant has two other computers, as well as 3 smart devices that can be used to input guests orders and run credit cards. It’s the end of the shift and it’s slow, so running with one less computer is really no big deal. And setting up a rolling area does not completely block the computer, it just gets pushed back about 6 inches. 


Well micromanaging coworker absolutely cannot handle this 6 inches. She complains that her back hurts and she can’t reach the computer (even though there are other computers) and says that she needs to use this one specifically. Why specifically this one, I don’t know, and she’s the only server on at this point so it’s not as though the other computers are in use. So anytime she needs the computer we have to move all our rolling stuff out of the way. This is annoying, not a huge deal, probably added 15 minutes to our task, whatever. 


So other coworker and I are done with silverware, have rolled collectively about 300 sets, the marking trays are filled (but not over filled.) The restaurant is closed now, and we have been cut for about an hour. We get micromanaging coworker so we can show her our roll ups, an unspoken nicety for the closing server. She then somehow makes up this rule that we need to wait for all the tables to leave so we can roll that silverware. I thought she was joking, so I laugh and say no. She then undoes our beautifully laid out marking trays and tells us to roll those. This does not sit well with my rolling partner, and he blows up at her. They are having a moderately loud back and forth disagreement with angry emotions. I walk away and grab my manager because I do not get paid to deal with this. The solution for that night was we had rolled enough, and were allowed to go home. 


Cut to two weeks ago, a weeknight shift, two servers. It’s moderately slow, but busy enough for two servers. I get cut around 830, but I still have a table who is enjoying drinks until close at 10pm. My table leaves at about 10:15pm. I grab some freshly washed silverware from dish, and see micromanaging coworker doing her closing duties (sweeping, cleaning up coffee machine, etc.) Those tasks don’t take too long. 10:40pm comes along and I’m still rolling, and the closer is supposed to help finish silverware and dismiss the cut server, if there is that much silverware.  The dishwasher then comes out with another load of silverware, easily another hundred sets. I have already rolled at least 200 sets by this point. I look for my micromanaging coworker so she can help me with the last of the silverware, but nope she’s gone and left. I was really tired(I had been at school all day) so tired I didn’t even have to energy to be angry, but smart enough to know to know this is unfair. Brought it up to the manager on shift, he lets me go home. 

The following Saturday there’s a discussion about silverware at the shift meeting. It’s agreed upon that a cut person should roll 100-150 silverware, but does not need to wait around for more silverware to be washed. The last of the silverware is the responsibility of the closer. 


Cut to this past Wednesday. Again, two servers, me and micromanaging coworker. I get cut around 8. My tables don’t stick around, I rolled 150 silverware, and it’s about 9pm. There have been a decent amount of new tables for the new server, and the bar rail is also full with guests. Bus tubs are full, and in the dish room I can hear the dishwasher running through silverware. The busser comes up to me and tells me micromanaging coworker is talking crazy crap about me, how I’m lazy and didn’t do enough silverware. I decide to not talk to her, show my roll ups to my manager and inform them of the shit talking going on. He cashes me out and says I’m free to go. 


I just don’t want to deal with her today. At the age of 50 you should be mature enough to be able to handle a job and not do things only on your terms. She always has something passive aggressive to say. Once the Spotify list playing was a rockabilly station, she asked my opinion, I said it was ok but I’m not much of a music person. She then responded “Oh yeah that makes sense you don’t have much style.” I dress very basic(jeans, black nikes, sorel boots, plain target shirts )wear basic makeup, have normal colored hair and no tattoos or piercings. She has fun  hair and makeup, a nose ring, lots of visible tattoos, wears fun skirts and leggings. 


She’ll try to train the new people to not like a certain manager. That’s just being insubordinate. 


And she touches her shoulder length hair all the time. That’s just gross. 


I just don’t want to deal with her tonight.


Update- tonight she was the first cut server, there were 4 of us. Before she started rolling she asked the closing server if she really had to roll 100 silverware, because she only had X amount of covers. She always tries to change the rules to suit what benefits her. The closer told her no, to roll 100. We were a bit busy so the closer wasn’t able to follow up if she had actually rolled that many.

I am wondering if anyone might have any advice for my predicament. 

About a week ago, I had a bit of an accident, and partially severed the tendon in my right (dominant hand 😑) thumb. I ended up having to have a splint wrapped in an ace bandage put on my hand for three and a half weeks. I have about a week and a half longer in the splint, and things are really not going super great. I have about eight more shifts to do with my hand like this before I am able to really use my hand again. I just started this job fairly recently, and absolutely can't lose it. The easiest problem to deal with is keeping it dry. I've tried a few different gigantic rubber gloves, and seem to be doing an okay job at avoiding getting moisture on my bandage. The biggest problem is obviously that I am rather ineffective at using my right hand. My thumb is entirely immobilized, so I am not really able to grasp much with my right hand.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I recently started as an assistant in the dining room of a boarding house.


1. If someone has put their serviette on top of their plate or inside of their dessert bowl, is it okay to assume they have finished? Should I ask them “Excuse me, do you mind if I take your plate/bowl?” or is it okay for me to just take it? (especially if they are in conversation, I don’t want to disturb them but I've also been told that asking shows respect for them.)



2. When I give someone their dessert, what should I say? When I give people their main meal, I usually say “enjoy your meal” but that sounds kinda strange for dessert and previously I’ve just said “enjoy” up until now but that also sounds kinda strange to me. I’ve also had other times where I’ve not said anything, just waited for them to say thankyou and then replied “you’re welcome”. Is the last way the best way?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I  say thankyou when taking someone’s plate/bowl away? Or can I just take it without saying anything else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told to serve from the left with my left hand where possible. However, at rectangle tables this isn’t always possible where I can’t get between two people and have to serve from the right. The same goes for clearing plates/taking them away, I’ve been told to do this from the right with my right hand, which I try to do, but it isn’t always possible and often I have to clear from the left. Do people really care about this sort of thing if they can see it isn’t possible. I think I heard some people murmuring about me today in regards to which side I was doing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work at a small local pizza/Italian place. A few hours during the days we offer a lunch buffet with pizza, pasta, salads etc. It's immensely popular and we're usually packed to capacity every lunch period. And honestly the food is really good and has a good reputation in town.

I come in contact with all kinds of assholes and weirdos at work (don't we all) but I really hate the ones who like to complain in order to get something free.

So these two ladies in their 40s come in, and stare at the menu for a while. We have counter service so I greeted them kindly and told them to let me know when they were ready to order. They ask me how long it would take for a small veggie pizza to be ready, I told them about 15 minutes. One sister scoffs loudly, ""ugh! We don't have TIME for that!""

I suggested that they try our buffet since we still had it. They inspect the buffet offerings, clearly not really interested in it because they complained about everything. ""Everything has meat in it! We can't eat anything here, we are VEGETARIANS!""


One sister is literally yelling so I nicely showed them all the meat-free options to help them out. I showed them the salad bar, pasta salad, cheese pizza, broccoli bites, cheese ravioli, spaghetti etc. The mean sister yells at me ""did you not hear me? I said we're VEGETARIANS and this spaghetti sauce CLEARLY HAS MEAT IN IT!!!"" I said no, actually it's just a marinara tomato sauce, no meat at all.

After all that hateful deliberation they decided to eat the buffet. Ok, cool, finally we came to a decision.

A little bit after, I start bussing tables in between customers. Mean sister starts yelling again, shouting for me across the dining room, snapping her fingers at me, ""hey, MISS! EXCUSE ME!"" I quickly walk over to their table. I ask if everything is ok.

Mean sister tells me ""not at all, this food is absolutely DISGUSTING and INEDIBLE."" I notice there's at least 4-5 empty plates on their table from where they've eaten, and she shoves them at me and I had to reach over to prevent them from falling to the floor. I was about ready to snap at them but somehow managed to say ""I'm sorry to hear that -"" and she cuts me off and rudely demands a refund. I didn't even respond and walked away to find my manager.

My manager has no patience for complaining customers and usually avoids refunds whenever possible. He refused to refund them since they finished off a few plates each before saying they didn't like it. Eventually they left in a huff.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I’m a culinary student and I’ve been working for a hotel-restaurant in the heart of Budapest for half a year now.
Usual morning - bussing tables for the breakfast buffet. Today we had tons of amazing guests and I loved listening to their stories and giving them directions and ideas on what to do/visit in the city. 

Lunch rolls around. We had our quarter yearly staff birthday(s) first. This is basically how we celebrate the staff’s birthdays from the last three months four times a year on one day with a 3 course meal - the dessert being a slice of birthday cake. After we served that a few remained and our coworker in charge let us have one.

Then the À la cartes start coming in and I got a table of 7 - These Irish Gentlemen knew what they wanted from the start - knew how they’d be paying and we’re genuinely amazing about what I’m about to describe next.
As they came in they ordered 7 rums - so I bring those in first - orange slices and brown sugar in tow. 

They politely ask me to bring them 7 colas - separately and apologize for not specifying that they wanted rum&amp;coke from the start. So I get the 7 glass bottles of coke on my metal tray. You know the ones.

After putting down the first four I trip, hard - dropping the tray and basically headbutting the floor and dousing myself in ice-cold coca-cola on an already cold day. 

Now you need to know that I can’t handle messing up due to aspergers. Any mistake puts a ball &amp; chain on me emotionally and affects my mental health because I put myself down by replaying it on loop unconsciously.

My coworkers imediatelly jumped in to help by mopping up, picking up the bottles (thankfully none broke), serving the customers and by providing me with a new shirt and apron. 
Even the capital B Boss acted like a true leader and instead of the hellfire I thought he’d unleash said that it happens to the best of us and that everything is and will be okay. 

After putting on the new clothes I went to offer my sincere apologies the folks at the table simply said “Just have a shot rum on us, it’ll straighten you out for the next table, seriously though, no problem”

,TalesFromYourServer,"So this happened around early September I’m a busboy at a sea food restaurant a 2 towns away from my town. We get up to 2 hour waits over the summer into late December, it gets crazy especially when the band plays (which is every night) and people start dancing. 

So I’m not sure if other restaurants use trays for bussing, I’ve only seen them used in fine dining places, which is what we’re considered except we seems right below that title if you ask me because of how hectic it gets. 

Anyways, I’m clearing plates, stacking trays and bring them to the kitchen. This is constant until closing and then some if we still have tables. 

It’s around 6pm when this elderly couple calls me over while I’m cleaning a table and I’m thinking, “cool they’re gonna want some extra tartar sauce”. But, the wife surprises me with complementing my work ethic. I was having a shitty night and this sparked a flame in my heart. The husband continues off his wife and also compliments me while referring to my name tag which is also a nice boost. 

I thank them and get back to work. After an hour or so it looks like the couples finishing up, they call me over again and the husband slides me a $20. I’ve never received a side tip higher than $5 so I was shocked, I tried to hand it back but he insisted. I went mach 5 the rest of the night. 

2 weeks later I’m clearing off this 4 top when this lady surprisingly says my name. I shift my gaze to see the couple from before and of course treat them like good friends, I greet them and shake the husbands hand.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’m a food server at a fairly prominent Midwest Casino, so I deal with entitled people on the daily. However, as I’m closing up our fine dining restaurant tonight, I just experienced the epitome of entitled.

The restaurant I work at stays open an hour later on Fridays and Saturday’s, but these particular folks are VIP’s of the casino, they are here every single day, so they know our hours. On top of that, they’ve come here for so long and so often that the Casino comps 100% of the food they eat.

So the story:

It’s about 20 minutes after we close. I still have a table celebrating their anniversary, so they are taking their time. No big deal, but due to this we are not allowed to close the doors separating the restaurant from the casino. As I’m tending to my table, I look up and see EL (entitled lady) and her husband NSED (not so entitled dude).

EL: Walks past the host stand and starts frantically waving at me.

Me: *arms full of dishes, so I give a slight nod to acknowledge them, and turn to the kitchen to drop off the dishes. I tell my supervisor we have someone up front

S: (supervisor) Hows it going, EL?

EL: Great! We would like a table for two, or we can sit at the bar since it’s so late.

S: erm, you know we close early on weekdays. I can see if (another restaurant that’s still OPEN) has any available seating.

EL: whips out her players card for the casino I’m an (upgraded member of the casino). I’d like a table for two please.

S: EL, we’ve already send the kitchen staff home. There’s nobody who can make your food.

EL: points at the only guests in the room But they’re eating!!!!!

S: They had a reservation for (an hour and a half before we closed). And they politely let us know they would not be ordering dessert, when we checked on their food. So we sent the kitchen staff home.

EL: brain begins to melt but....

NSED: Babe, we knew it was a long shot. Let’s just go to the other restaurant before they close.

However, as I’m closing up our fine dining restaurant tonight, I just experienced the epitome of entitled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant I work at stays open an hour later on Fridays and Saturday’s, but these particular folks are VIP’s of the casino, they are here every single day, so they know our hours. On top of that, they’ve come here for so long and so often that the Casino comps 100% of the food they eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about 20 minutes after we close. I still have a table celebrating their anniversary, so they are taking their time. No big deal, but due to this we are not allowed to close the doors separating the restaurant from the casino. As I’m tending to my table, I look up and see EL (entitled lady) and her husband NSED (not so entitled dude).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EL: Walks past the host stand and starts frantically waving at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: *arms full of dishes, so I give a slight nod to acknowledge them, and turn to the kitchen to drop off the dishes. I tell my supervisor we have someone up front&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: (supervisor) Hows it going, EL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EL: Great! We would like a table for two, or we can sit at the bar since it’s so late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: erm, you know we close early on weekdays. I can see if (another restaurant that’s still OPEN) has any available seating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EL: whips out her players card for the casino I’m an (upgraded member of the casino). I’d like a table for two please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: EL, we’ve already send the kitchen staff home. There’s nobody who can make your food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EL: points at the only guests in the room But they’re eating!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: They had a reservation for (an hour and a half before we closed). And they politely let us know they would not be ordering dessert, when we checked on their food. So we sent the kitchen staff home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EL: brain begins to melt but....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSED: Babe, we knew it was a long shot. Let’s just go to the other restaurant before they close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EL: But we spend so much money heeeeere. They really can’t open up just for us?!&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Since this is one of the biggest restaurant-related subs, I'm posting this notification we got from our accountant:

**Coronavirus and Its Impact on Restaurants**

I just wanted to reach out and give you all a heads up on what’s going on out there right now with the coronavirus issues and restaurants in particular. We are hearing that various cities are preparing a protocol if a restaurant is named as a location where the virus has spread from – it’s pretty brutal – closure for up to 14 days minimum, and all employees will need to be tested before returning to work. Two bad issues there – insurance doesn’t cover the closure (it is excluded on business interruption coverage), and if employees get the virus at work, it is probably a work comp claim.

So, with that environment pending, it is crucial that restaurants put in place some protocols immediately while we work our way through this issue. At a minimum, I would suggest the following:

A notification to all employees regarding:

* Hand washing, with hot soapy water, should be done at a minimum every fifteen (15) minutes or any time they have come in contact with food or beverages.
* Employees should avoid touching their face or hair at all times.
* Tables/bar tops should be “hot wiped” in between each customer's use – again with hot soapy water and sanitized with a clean towel.
* Bathrooms, assuming they were properly cleaned, should be cleaned again every hour, including all surfaces hot wiped and sanitized with a clean towel.
* All surfaces, menus, door hardware, or areas where employees and guests touch should be wiped down and sanitized on an ongoing intra-daily schedule.
* Avoid handshaking with other employees and guests.
* Gloves should be worn by all employees producing/prepping any food. Also, gloves should be worn when sorting or handling silverware.

If an employee calls out sick with flu-like symptoms, they should be required to be cleared by a doctor before returning to work. While California law generally restricts an employer from requiring a doctor’s note unless the employee has been absent for more than three days or is without protected State sick leave, you also have to balance the ongoing protection of co-workers and the guests that could come in contact with the employee given the pandemic. Indeed, just today, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a local health emergency declaration for the County. Please discuss this with your labor attorney resource to decide what your policy will be, but you should certainly get notification out to your employees, so they know what to expect.

If an employee is at the restaurant and is showing signs of illness, they should be sent home immediately and can use accrued sick pay for their absence.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This was a while back, but I’ll never forget it. I was working as a lunch server for a new (at the time) restaurant at an amusement park. This story revolves around a lady, probably in her 50’s who was dining with her family and very not happy about the cook of her pita bread. 

Her family was one of my first tables of the day, so I was at the top of my customer service game. They ordered and everything went normally. The lady ordered pita bread and hummus as an appetizer. No problem, I send their order to the kitchen and I’m told I have two new tables. I take my time greeting my new tables knowing that our food runner would deliver the appetizers to my table. 

I head back to send in my new orders and my busser is looking for me. He tells me that my table would like to speak to me. As I begin my walk over to their table, I see the lady standing by the food runner, and she does not look happy. I walk up to them, and she turns to look at me. I noticed she’s holding a piece of pita bread. 

Lady: I can not believe you expect me to eat this. 

Me (not knowing what she is talking about): I’m sorry, was their a problem with your food? 

Lady: A problem?! This is inedible!  

As she says this, she holds out the pita bread to me. I assume she is handing it to me, and reach to take it. She grabs my hand.. and slaps my hand with the pita bread! 

After the third slap, she says: Can you feel how hard this is?? This is unacceptable! 

Me, still dumbfounded: I will get you fresh pita bread right away, and you will not be charged for your appetizer. 

She just grunted and walked back to her table. 

I just stood there for a bit, before the food runner busts out laughing. After a second, I join in, I could not believe what happened. 

After telling my manager what happened, he just laughed, comped their appetizer and finished serving their table. I asked my manager at the end of the shift, and to no surprise, no tip. 

The funny thing is.. why me? All I did was take the order; the chef cooked it, and then the food runner dropped it off. Her slapping me with the pita bread was the first time I had even seen it.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This happened a couple of years ago, but it was the most unsafe I had ever felt in a restaurant. I worked as a server assistant in a family steakhouse. The original owner retired and sold his restaurant to some millionaire CEO who changed everything. It was a place of memories for a lot of the locals, and it was affordable since you could order steak by the ounce, but the management changed it to an overpriced steakhouse for the CEO to brag about to his friends and clientele. When they renovated the place they split it into a bar section and family section. In the bar side they only hired pretty young girls, no guys on that side except for the bartenders. Later, they enforced a uniform that was a short black wrap dress that showed their cleavage. For some of the girls you could practically see their underwear. Everyone thought the dress was ridiculous, but only one girl refused to wear it. The bar side also had less tips as most people didn't order a full meal. The only plus to working on that side was if you got to serve the owner he would leave $100-$200 for the tip. Those girls would try to get promoted so they could serve in the family section. 

Since I was an SA i didn't really see much that was going on in the bar side, just that there was a high turn around for those waitresses. one day a server in the family section abruptly stopped showing to work. While it was common for people to quit, I was surprised because she had really good work ethic and didn't give her 2 weeks notice. Likewise a lot of servers started quitting and the business slowed down.

During one of the holiday rushes, a girl who was promoted from bar side to the family side was complaining because she got really shitty tables. then a lot of the male servers were laughing at her. i didn't hear exactly what they said, but it seemed like they were slut shaming her. 

It wasn't until later that I found out why. I bumped into the coworker who quit suddenly at a store. We started to catch up when she talked about a ""horrible incident"". i had no idea what she was talking about, and she said ""you don't know?"". she told me that the upper management asked the bar waitresses to join them for a drink. then they said ""you're going to climb onto this bar and strip naked for us."" of course they said no. basically, the management got them drunk until they did. i want to mention that the type of girl that was hired in the bar positions were usually the same: nice, ditzy kind of girls who had a hard time saying no, and for some reason they were almost always brunette. anyways, one of the girl's boyfriends called worried about where she was. the management told her she was not going to answer her phone. she did anyway, but they ended the call. another girl's friends were worried about her since she wasn't answering her calls. they enter the restaurant and see what's happening. they tell the management that they're taking their friend with them, and the management actually tells them no. they eventually get her back. one of the girls was 18, and their parents wanted to sue for her, but she didn't want to and since she was a legal adult they couldn't without her permission. 

i didn't have any doubt that it happened. the managers would often ask the girls if they wanted a drink. sometimes they'd ask me as well, but i would always laugh and so no thx cuz i was a lightweight. even shortly before i heard about this, one of the managers that wasn't present at that incident made a rule there was to be no drinking during or after work at the bar. but of course the owner's brother still offered me and the other waitresses drinks. 

i got the f\*ck out of there. I called my friend who also worked there, and also told her to get out of there. 

I had worked there for months without knowing what had happened. my friend and i were the only ones who didn't know, both girls. the guys never told us, some of which we were friends with. instead they just slut shamed the girls it happened to. 

although they were really slow around the time they left, the restaurant is still open.

unfortunately, the next workplace i was employed at had it's own share of sexual harassment. the owner and the owner's son would grope the waitresses. when the head chef found out his own daughter had been groped, he didn't do anything. his sons, daughter, and brother were employed there.",t2_1ta7ig32,False,,0,False,Management Getting the Female Staff Drunk and Made Them Strip,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_fe8umy,False,dark,,public,17,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,17,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583501423.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened a couple of years ago, but it was the most unsafe I had ever felt in a restaurant.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So, I work for a place that’s a cafe during the day and a nightclub at night. It’s an adventure, and I love every minute of it. 

Sunday’s are insane. Usually the Saturday night close is rough, but I’ve learned to expect that, and I won’t speak badly about those that served until 3am and just were too tired to restock some napkins. I get it dude. 

Sunday is also walk-in 10-16 top day. It never fails. We get large groups back to back. We had a 15 person table come in, and my coworker, Sam (name changed) had it put in his section, and it took up every table he was assigned. 

Sam is a great server. He’s been in the industry for years and knows his stuff. He was attentive, constantly giving refills, making them laugh, etc. 

As things come to an end, people began leaving, so Sam asked if the check was all on one. Everyone at his table just looked around at each other and it was obvious that they had not planned out whether one person was footing the bill or if everyone was going separate. Half the table had left at this point, so one of the older gentlemen said “I guess it’s on one”. 

Sam took him the bill, and after they cashed out, they quickly left. This table left him $7 on a $240 check. 

Sam was devastated. They had been there through the entire lunch rush, so he missed out on a lot of turn around that made the rest of us some really good money. He told me that he was counting on today so that he could make his rent, and now he wasn’t sure what to do. He was going to ask to work a double after already working a double the day prior. 

Side note: I get that people should manage money accordingly, but I don’t know his personal life, and some of us to live day-by-day. I was there recently, I get it. Zero judgement. 

I felt so bad for him that I printed off another copy of the check and put $40 into a book with it and stacked it into some books by the register. I pretended that I had lost a signed receipt and was going through them next to him. I casually opened the one with his name in it and said “Sam, you left money in here. You idiot.” And handed it to him. I pretended to find mine and casually walked away. 

He came up to me and said that he was super confused because he had only had one book at the table, but now there was this one. I just looked at him and said “some things aren’t worth investigating”.

It’s an adventure, and I love every minute of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday’s are insane. Usually the Saturday night close is rough, but I’ve learned to expect that, and I won’t speak badly about those that served until 3am and just were too tired to restock some napkins. I get it dude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday is also walk-in 10-16 top day. It never fails. We get large groups back to back. We had a 15 person table come in, and my coworker, Sam (name changed) had it put in his section, and it took up every table he was assigned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam is a great server. He’s been in the industry for years and knows his stuff. He was attentive, constantly giving refills, making them laugh, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As things come to an end, people began leaving, so Sam asked if the check was all on one. Everyone at his table just looked around at each other and it was obvious that they had not planned out whether one person was footing the bill or if everyone was going separate. Half the table had left at this point, so one of the older gentlemen said “I guess it’s on one”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam took him the bill, and after they cashed out, they quickly left. This table left him $7 on a $240 check. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam was devastated. They had been there through the entire lunch rush, so he missed out on a lot of turn around that made the rest of us some really good money. He told me that he was counting on today so that he could make his rent, and now he wasn’t sure what to do. He was going to ask to work a double after already working a double the day prior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: I get that people should manage money accordingly, but I don’t know his personal life, and some of us to live day-by-day. I was there recently, I get it. Zero judgement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt so bad for him that I printed off another copy of the check and put $40 into a book with it and stacked it into some books by the register. I pretended that I had lost a signed receipt and was going through them next to him. I casually opened the one with his name in it and said “Sam, you left money in here. You idiot.” And handed it to him. I pretended to find mine and casually walked away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He came up to me and said that he was super confused because he had only had one book at the table, but now there was this one. I just looked at him and said “some things aren’t worth investigating”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m telling this story because I want everyone to know that there are good people in the world. We all will get that shitty table or Karen’s or a bad night, but I’m always looking out for my coworkers. I’m a strong believer in treat the way that you want to be treated, and I’m hoping my message will inspire others to offer to do a little extra side work or bring in some snacks to share during the rush.

,TalesFromYourServer,"For background, I served for two years in my hometown. Small country town, big church crowd and I never received no tip... except one time. To be fair, he was the groundskeeper at my neighborhoods golf course and I told him how I used to sled on the golf course on snow days as a kid. Groundskeepers don’t enjoy that. Otherwise tips at this mom and pop restaurant were steady 20-25%.

Then, I moved to downtown Charleston. I was a server assistant for fine dining and the tips were NICE. A majority of customers were businessmen paying with a company card who weren’t technically paying for the meal. So, I did great there.

Flash forward to now, I’m on my third shift at a new place and can’t believe how awful I am being tipped. My first ever table here left me nothing! My service was completely fine. I didn’t mess up their order, they never needed a refill, I was attentive to them. Then later that night, I got left nothing on a $157 bill. It was my training day, so I didn’t expect much. It stings though when your expected tip is on the receipt doesn’t match what you get, when you did nothing wrong. My next shift, 20% of my item sales would have been around $80, yet I only made $27. Today, same thing happened.

The area I live in now is low income OR college students. No matter how broke I am, I won’t go to a restaurant if I can’t tip. Another thing is, because I am new, I am not working busy weekends.

But from Reading alot of stories I get the impression most start with hosting.
Why is that?

,TalesFromYourServer,"I literally just got hired at this place. I am relatively new to the serving world so I didn't think to ask the question about what a normal night in sales is like. I showed up Tuesday for my first day of training and, to me, it was slow. I am used to 14 table sections and this restaurant had 8 tables total. I figured since I would be taking orders and running my own food, that this would be a decent sized section.

Well, they were so overwhelmed they sent me home because they couldn't ""train me properly"" with how busy it was. The dishwasher said he has never seen the restaurant so busy before in all the years he has been there. THERE WERE ONLY 6 OF THE 8 TABLES FULL. So basically, it's dead all the time. I'm supposed to come back this evening to train but I need to call and let them know it just isn't happening. I should have done some research and asked better questions during the interview.

They are a really sweet family owned business but I have to be able to pay my bills and no way in hell will I be walking away with more than 40 or 50 bucks a night on top of the 7 bucks an hour base rate that they pay.

I thought this was going to be a great fit as I was trying to get out of the corporate world but it just isn't. I'm really scared of making them upset and I am awful at having tough conversations (but I need to grow up and start doing that instead of just not showing up). Even worse is that an older lady in my AA group is neighbors with the owners and she told me when I got hired that they have a really tough time keeping employees. That they've tried to retire and no one wants to work there. So now I know that little tidbit and it makes me feel even worse. I am feeling like a massive C word right now. I had a weird feeling in my gut so I continued interviewing which leads me to my second question....

&amp;#x200B;

Q: I had a first interview at a bar in downtown. The AGM was really excited because the last few people she has interviewed have had no experience. She said she definitely wants to get me in for a second interview with the GM who will make the final call but said they were trying to get someone hired ASAP for March Madness and all the events coming up soon in Denver. This was on Tuesday afternoon, and it's Thursday now. Do I call at some point? Or do I just keep waiting? I would really like to work there as they do 1000-2000 in sales a night and are only open on the days I am available coincidentally.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Probably a bad way to put that, but eh. Blah blah blah on mobile.

I typically come in around 15-30 minutes early for work. It gives me time to use the restroom, make sure my hair / makeup / clothes are alright, and prepare myself for jumping into the chaos. 

Here lately, I've taken to hanging on in another place up the street before work, to minimize how early I come in.

Why? Because I have a manager that if I come in early, no matter how early, she'll inform me that's she's sat me with 3-4 tables. It's not a lot, and I can handle it, but I'm certainly not expecting it when I accidentally show up 45 minutes for a shift. I'd just hang around outside, but she'd honestly probably come find me to do something, on shift or not.

Admittedly, I'm willing to hop in if we're busy. Very busy, and at the request of other servers, especially if dinner rush came early.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I've made a post here before and I've got several more stories to add. This is by far one of my favorites.

In my last post I mentioned working at a well known seafood restaurant. Well prior to that I worked at their sister restaurant, but this one was Italian.

We had a bartender I'll refer to as Brenda. Sometimes Brenda will pick up serving shifts to make extra cash. Well on this one particular lunch shift, Brenda had a two top in which only one of the two women would speak to her. When the other woman was ordering, she would look at her friend and say ""tell our server that I want blah blah blah."" 

Brenda isn't shy, so she says ""I'm right here. You can just tell me.""

Lady: (Looking at her friend) Tell our server that I don't look at people who serve me. They're beneath me.

Brenda just rolled her eyes and was like fuck this. She didn't have any fucks to get into it with this lady. Turn and burn. The lady never looked at Brenda or spoke to her directly the entire time. 

Brenda took it all in stride and didn't let it affect the rest of her day. But she didn't forget that woman. Her face was burned into Brenda's mind. 

A few weeks had passed and Brenda came to me with a story of poetic justice.

Apparently, while on her lunch break, Brenda had visited a department store at the mall just up the street from the restaurant. And guess who she ran into? The lady who was too good to look at Brenda was an employee there hanging up cloths.

Without hesitation, Brenda walked up to the lady and said ""Hi! Remember me?! No, you wouldn't. Because you don't look at people when they're serving you. Well, I'm a 24 year old in medical school who works to pay her tuition. You on the other hand are a middle aged woman hanging up cloths for a living."" 

She then grabs as many cloths as she can and throws them on the floor and says ""Have fun picking those up. But I won't be looking at you as you do because I don't look at people who pick up cloths off the floor."" 

She walks away. I asked her what the lady's facial expression was, but Brenda said she didn't bother to turn around and look. She got her justice and kept walking. 

I really really really want to believe that Brenda's actions kicked that lady into being more respectful to others.

Edit: Forgot to add that about 80% of employment in my hometown is blue collar. So for anyone to be uppity to another person is just stupid. We were all on the same playing field.

,TalesFromYourServer,"My beautiful servers of Reddit,

We've had a bit of an uproar in our restaurant. One of our servers had a large party of early twenties boys on vacation in our town from New York. Our server is a lovely, bubbly, caring, adorable, little button that I adore with all my heart. The boys all saw what I see in her and decided to leave their phone numbers on their chit sheets. Every. Single. One of them left their number. She felt objectified. 

So one of the other girls on the team took a pic of the sheets and sent them in the work group WhatsApp essentially making a joke of the blatant sexual inappropriateness. Well our manager commented asking if it was joke. We said it wasn't. Well he decided to send message essentially saying that this server must've done something inappropriate with the table to elicit such a reaction. 

As you can guess, all hell has broken loose. Every single female employee has sent him a message essentially saying what the fuck how are you blaming your server for this? We as women deal with shit like this on the regular and you're blaming us for it? What the fucking fuck!? 

Well I realized, how the hell is our manager supposed to know these things if we never tell him? If we suffer with this in silence how is he supposed to help? It also became very clear that alot of our female team members don't know how to rebuke these advances with out submitting or just being silent. They don't have the tools to cordially let someone know that was inappropriate without escalating the situation and having a guest become angry with them. 

So ladies of Reddit, what are some ways you've found to deal with these situations in a professional and cordial way? If a guy asks if you have a bf or for your number what do you say? If they touch inappropriately what do you do? What are things management has done to back you?

,TalesFromYourServer,"Evening chaps,

So I've been working in the liquor industry for about six months now, but today is my first day at a different store in my area. 

So as far as first days go, this one was nothing exceptional. A decent crowd came in for a Wednesday, and one older gentleman was flabbergasted he found a fellow lord of the rings fan. But that was all about to change. (Insert music for effect)

So earlier in the day this one guy came in. You could immediately tell he was a few eggs short of a dozen mentally, but nothing flagrant or obnoxious in his behavior. He bought a beer and went on his merry way. About an hour goes by and the property manager comes down and warns of this guy whose high as a kite drinking beer in the bathroom, causing a ruckus.

It was our guy.

He came back a second time and bought a six pack and a shot of 99. This time he goes and irks the rest of the management who unbeknownst to us have filed trespassing papers because he is becoming a public nuisance. 

But like the quote states, third times the charm. 

He comes back and gets a pack of cigarettes, and as he does the local security woman comes in and tells him he can't be here (remember, trespassing). He replies in some manner of buzz off, I couldn't quite make out what he said because I was with a different customer. 

It's at this point they both walk outside, and loud voices can be heard. The inflection in them denotes a less then pleasant conversation. Me and my manager hear this and move to the door to see what's going on. 

The scene we are witness too is absolutely incredible. He Is standing in front of an SUV screaming at the guy to ""hit him"" and that ""this is my lot."" No sooner does he say that a patrol car pulls up. Then a second one.

As the one officer goes after the guy to try and talk to her, he flips her the finger, calls her a bitch, then books it down the road.

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been working in the liquor industry for about six months now, but today is my first day at a different store in my area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as far as first days go, this one was nothing exceptional. A decent crowd came in for a Wednesday, and one older gentleman was flabbergasted he found a fellow lord of the rings fan. But that was all about to change. (Insert music for effect)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So earlier in the day this one guy came in. You could immediately tell he was a few eggs short of a dozen mentally, but nothing flagrant or obnoxious in his behavior. He bought a beer and went on his merry way. About an hour goes by and the property manager comes down and warns of this guy whose high as a kite drinking beer in the bathroom, causing a ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was our guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He came back a second time and bought a six pack and a shot of 99. This time he goes and irks the rest of the management who unbeknownst to us have filed trespassing papers because he is becoming a public nuisance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like the quote states, third times the charm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He comes back and gets a pack of cigarettes, and as he does the local security woman comes in and tells him he can&amp;#39;t be here (remember, trespassing). He replies in some manner of buzz off, I couldn&amp;#39;t quite make out what he said because I was with a different customer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s at this point they both walk outside, and loud voices can be heard. The inflection in them denotes a less then pleasant conversation. Me and my manager hear this and move to the door to see what&amp;#39;s going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene we are witness too is absolutely incredible. He Is standing in front of an SUV screaming at the guy to &amp;quot;hit him&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;this is my lot.&amp;quot; No sooner does he say that a patrol car pulls up. Then a second one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the one officer goes after the guy to try and talk to her, he flips her the finger, calls her a bitch, then books it down the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;m totally blown, because while not the most incredible thing to ever happen, never have I had the cops called on someone before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I don't know if this counts since I wasn't on my shift but it still happened where I work so here we go, I wanted to share:

Yesterday night I was walking the dog when I decided I wanted to get a coffee at the bar I work at and I noticed a police car was parked too nearby to be good news. Surely when I enter, there's this guy inside, totally wasted, banging his hands on the counter screaming for ""liquor! Two! And it's free! I won't pay!""

Needless to say my coworker, a petite girl, was scared as hell while cops were watching the scene from outside. The screaming and banging scared my dog so much she wanted to run away from the bar so I went out but kept an eye on the situation from afar in case I was needed, even though another coworker (off shift) and the boss were inside.

I took my eyes off of the door for *two seconds* to readjust the leash that got tangled when I hear screaming and turn just in time to see the drunk guy come out, throw liquor in the face of one cop and smashing the glass in his face. The cop pepper sprayed him and the guy ran away. Of course I catched a good whiff of the pepper spray and my throat and nose started burning like hell.

Droplets of blood decorated the sidewalk as I could notice as I walked in back again to get a glass of milk to stop the itching, while the guy was getting handcuffed meters away and the cop was drying his blood with towels.

My coworker was okay, her boyfriend arrived shortly after and she told me it all began because the drunk guy asked for a cigarette, a man gave it to him and he took it and slapped him in the face for no reason. Then he got in the face of another girl and started screaming at her, again, for no reason, so cops were called when he started demanding alcohol and banging on the counted scaring all customers.

I was told from another bartender from another bar that this is not his first time being violent. Let's hope this guy will stay home for a while. 

By the way my dog is fine, bit scared, but she got hella cuddles throughout and after the situation!

Edit: the guy was taken to his home after being to the police, where they discovered he was under the influence of something he recently injected and alcohol and put in house arrest (I'm not sure that's how you say it, basically he had to stay home for a period of time, as per the law).

,TalesFromYourServer,"Forever ago I worked at a dive bar on Friday nights. Now this particular bar is a bit odd, an old biker bar that attracts a typically middle-aged blue collar crowd, but also frequently rents out the backroom for parties ranging from quincenaras to rockbands.

Anyways, it is slow near closing with one semi-regular and two other customers I've never seen before, some rough looking middle age white lady in baggy sweats, and this guy who has big fake teeth (I named him Gary-Busey-Teeth) whom I can't understand a word out of his mouth. I'm the only employee.

After a couple beers, the lady orders a shot of Johnny Walker Red.  When I inform her we don't carry red, but Johnny Walker Black she says, ""I don't want no [N-bomb] shot!""
Now if my description above didn't paint an accurate picture of the bar, this place has the look of one that you could get away with such things. Even if it were (which it isn't on my shifts anyways), the semi-regular sitting with just one empty stool between them was black!

I stare at her in disbelief for a second...""Are you #@!#ing kidding me?"" I ask (as the consummate professional I am). At this point she just happens to notice the other patron and proceeds to apologize profusely saying she was just trying to be funny and didn't realize he was there. My regular, Aaron let's say, was more patient and understanding than he needed to be, and was like ""whatever, it's fine.""
I cut her off, and let Gary-Busey-teeth finish his beer before they have to leave*, and think that's the end of it.

Wrong.

Well, she and Gary-Busey-Teeth start arguing, which I can't really follow because I can't really understand him, but escalates real fast and she stands up and punches GBT in the head!
GBT jumps up and finally chooses this sentence to articulate clearly: ""why are you hitting me on accord of this [n-bomb]?!""

I tell them to GTFO, but Aaron is understandably beyond his limit, and he and GBT start yelling at each other.

Rough looking white lady doesn't appreciate not being the center of attention. So she pushes up her sleeve, whips out a razor blade and, like Slash doing a guitar solo, windmill buries it into her own forearm. Like a cheap horror film I see the skin separate and for a beat it is just a gaping purple gash. Then the blood comes.

I immediately call the police say ""I work at [bar well known by police] and this lady slashed her self with a razor. She cut herself; the black guy did not do it!"" (Grew up in Jersey during widespread racial profiling)

At this point Aaron and GBT are face to face and don't see this, and she is screaming at their backs, blood running down her arm and onto the floor.  I'm worried she might slash at Aaron with the blade still in her hand, and grab her by the wrists from behind to restrain her while we await the police. They get there like 45 seconds later and the rest is a bit of a blur as I see this nutjob's blood all over my bar and me and what just happened catches up to me.

At this point i should mention that when she shoved up her sleeve i did notice there were dozens of scars, and she was well known to the police (and the triage nurse i talked to at the hospital after i closed up. Lol after I explained why I was there ""oh, honey, you're the one this happened to? You don't have open wounds you'll be okay!"").

*I didn't immediately boot them as a few weeks before I had told a guy to get out after he was stealing bubbles from other patrons, and tacitly threatened me with violence for cutting him off...and he knew the owner and it was implied I should have just cut him off and not told him to leave.",t2_5n2gdday,False,,0,False,Dangers of working at a dive bar,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_fd34hi,False,dark,,public,145,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,145,,False,nsfw,1583279213.0,,[],{},,True,,1583304705.0,text,3,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forever ago I worked at a dive bar on Friday nights.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Sorry for ranting, I'm one anxious peanut and I'd like to thank you if you read this, it really means a lot to me.

So I just recently started working at this salad bar and got put on many morning shifts. I've probably done 3 shifts myself with no proper training (I guess they assume I'd automatically know with common sense). Work is alright and the owners are actually really nice. But I'm terrified of the manager. Today I accidentally burnt a whole bucket of broccoli and coudnt wash up any dishes as I as serving a difficult and fussy customer. Then I got told off real bad when my manager came in. Told her my situation but she said that I should've finished my job before serving the customer (I served her a little earlier before the scheduled opening time). 

Mistakes started to pile up as Im a really anxious person and kept making mistakes after mistakes. I have a shift tomorrow and the manager is coming in to show me how to open to store properly. I'm screwed cause I opened up a new batch of soup instead of using the old one (I was told by the boss that we were supposed to rotate the soups we use...but eek what do I know?) totally terrified of getting told off for tomorrow and potentially even wasting MORE food.... Then got a call just now from the owner's daughter, she was really nice and diplomatic about it but regardless I feel like shit making so many goddamn mistakes today. I'm having exams currently and my mom being sick has gave me a mountain of anxiety that's affecting my work severely.

How do you recharge / stop making mistakes after feeling like shit after the first one??

Following mistakes : putting dirty measuring cup with the clean ones, giving a regular customer a smaller serving size (he used his own container and I wasn't used to it), putting sauce on the side of the salad instead of putting it in a separate small container (communication error), misreading an order and making an extra order instead.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Sorry for formatting. I’m on mobile and just remembered this sub. This happened a couple of years back when I was working two jobs. A little bit of background. I used to work at a family owned pizza and pub joint that was directly adjacent to a rather corporate and Boujee breakfast place. A lot of the back of the house staff worked at both the pizza and the breakfast place and I knew them well from being the bartender at the pizza place. I was really cool with most of them because when I would bartend I would always hook up an extra shift drink (out of my tips) and would always look the other way when the back of the house would bring their own alcohol in. Our head chef at the pizza place, let’s call him “C,” was also the head chef at the breakfast place. So C had a little pull around both spots. 

So some personal shit happens and all of a sudden I need to find a second job. Here’s where my relationship with the kitchen is important. It was extremely difficult to get hired at the Boujee breakfast place. They had almost no turnover and I knew this first hand as some of the servers from Boujee breakfast would stop by my bar after their shifts and get apps and drinks. For the most part they were pretty cool and I went to high school with one of them. 

Anyway I’m talking to the servers from Boujee Breakfast and ask if they’re hiring as I needed a second job. They said they just had a server move away and they got excited at the idea of me working with them. The excitement dissipated when the girl I knew from high school, let’s call her “A,” said “yeah but Linda (Boujee breakfast GM) doesn’t really hire male servers. And your beard will be a huge issue.”  I say that’s ok and figure I’ll try and use C as a reference and see what happens. Can’t hurt to apply. 

C gets me an interview. I shave my beard. A part of my soul dies with it. And I nail the interview and get the job. I’m certain I wouldn’t have been hired without C’s recommendation, so you better believe I had a case of beer hidden for him that night at the pizza place. 

Now I’m working doubles every day but it really wasn’t that bad. The Boujee breakfast place was very corporate and that took some adjusting but I was a professional and it wasn’t anything I couldn’t handle. I make my way through training and quickly adapt to the culture. The serving staff there was all very kind as even the servers I didn’t know accepted me, mostly cause I needed money and would take any shift available. This included hosting shifts. I’m not above working any job. 

Linda, the GM, however was not too fond of me. I have a big personality and I like to have fun and Linda was obviously wary of how warmly the front and back of the house warmed up to me. Linda didn’t like me from the start. Like she wrote me up in my first week for having facial hair when I had shaved that morning and had a little 1 pm shadow. I grow a damn good beard. But no big deal. I started shaving in the back bathroom mid shift to try and keep a good first impression. 

So one day I’m covering for one of the hostesses. Now every morning we’d have a team meeting where we would review the specials with the kitchen and go over any items that may be limited or 86ed that day. Our morning meeting goes about the day and we’re told we have everything. 

My only restaurant experience was from the pizza place so I had no fuckin clue what a secret shopper was, nor did I really care. Also no one bothered to tell me that was a thing. Had they told me, it honestly would not have made any difference. But I guess at the Boujee breakfast you wanted to get a secret shopper as if you got a 100 on your report, the owners gave you a $50 bonus. Super cool of them. 

So I’m hosting and I take a to go order for some dish with steak and eggs. I send it through just fine the customer pays over the phone. Less than 30 seconds later C sends someone from the kitchen up front to let me know that they don’t have steak that day and they can substitute another meat or the customer can order something else. Honest mistake. Whatever. I try calling the customer and it goes to voicemail. Try a couple more times and was not able to get ahold of him. Left a message 

We were super busy and the kitchen is backed up. I’m still New and very nervous that I’m going to get written up again for this. 

So the customer arrives and I told him I’m very sorry that we don’t have steak and he sees that I tried to call him. He’s very chill and says that’s ok can you bring me the same thing with sausage and bacon? A wave of relief comes over me as double meat prices out the same as one premium meat. So I can adjust the original ticket to the kitchen without needing a new payment. I run to the kitchen to tell C about it and he said it’ll be on the fly. 

The customer is so cool about the whole thing that I wanted to do something nice for him. So I ask if he’d like anything complimentary to drink and he said a cup of coffee would be great. 

So I ring up a cup of coffee and I don’t have cash on me (hosting that day) so I just pay with my credit card. Yes I paid out of my own pocket for the coffee. With my credit card which has my name on it. I rang the coffee up as a split ticket under the customers name. Obviously I tendered it separately. 

I give him the coffee and say “This is on Boujee Breakfast. We really appreciate your understanding and patience”

Customer gets his food in record time and he leaves with a smile. I had no idea he was a shopper until I came into work one day and everyone is whispering about me. Now A comes up to me and it goes something like this:

A: do you remember when we didn’t have steak last week and you took a carry out? 

Me: yeah I do. Why what’s up?

A: well the customer was a secret shopper. 

Me: ok...

A: did you give him a free cup of coffee?

Me: yeah 

A: Linda read the report and she is pisssssed. She’s going to call you in her office and you’re probably fired for stealing. 

So I start to laugh and A thinks I’m not taking her seriously. I let her know that I paid out of pocket for the coffee and she gets why I’m laughing now. 

Linda calls me in her office shortly after and makes me read the report. Specifically she makes me read the part where the customer indicates that I said the coffee was on Boujee Breakfast. She asked if I had anything to say for myself and why she shouldn’t fire me right then and there. I ask Linda if she checked the ticket. 

Linda makes a weird face and asks why she should check the ticket. I let her know that I didn’t steal anything. I paid for the coffee myself and if she pulls the ticket she can see my name with the time stamp. 

Linda pulls the ticket and I’ve never seen someone so disappointed that their employee was telling them the truth. She offered no apology and I replied with a shit eating grin. 

She didn’t talk to me much after that and I got poached into an office job by a regular shortly after.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hello all. Let me preface this by giving a little bit of background. I'm a young female who is currently still in school (well, it's online school, but that's how I'm getting my education.) This is the first job I've ever had, and since day 1 I feared I wasn't cut out for it, since I'm really introverted and have trouble/not much experience socializing.

I took this job because it was one of the only jobs I was qualified for, and I really needed the extra funds. All I did was apply online, and when I came to the restaurant to check on the status of my application, I was hired on the spot. I had about three days of training, and after that, I was put on the floor (which was a very busy night.) I did way better than I expected, but the whole night I was there, I was very anxious and only had two tables, but I survived the first night just fine, even though I made some mistakes.

Fast forward a month later, and I'm still working here. But here's the catch--I worked mostly only days where it wasn't very busy, and I only work part time. When dinner rush hits and our place is packed, I really get stressed out. I'm not a fast worker, however I'm good at operating the PoS, but I have to really take my time. I still make lots of mistakes, and I constantly ask questions, even after a month of being with the company. I don't even know how to properly carry trays, and I can hardly stomach taking phone-in orders due to my anxiety. We're also very understaffed and it can get hectic, with our busiest night only being three servers, two cooks and the assistant manager. I'm still not used to constantly socializing and working in this extremely fast paced environment, and the other day, my GM yelled at me and that really triggered my anxiety, to the point where I started experiencing tremors in my body from being stressed out. When I get anxiety attacks, I can experience long-term physical symptoms.

I'm starting to feel like I'm not cut out for this type of work. Even though I only work at night, I'm really starting to have doubts about staying here due to being very anxious and sensitive. I'm not exactly on the best terms with my GM, and I get so stressed out on nights when I have to work with him. I just don't see myself staying here long term, but I feel so guilty about already having thoughts of quitting, even though this is my first job and my family and friends are proud of me. I don't want to let anyone down, but my mental health has been taking a hit. Even on my off days and before I go to work, I get anxiety just from thinking about going back to work. Also, I've been trying to get my weekends off because I need that time to focus on finishing school, but my request for off days have been getting ignored.

I&amp;#39;d like to do hands free pump, but I don&amp;#39;t know if the make a hands free pump that is conducive to also taking tables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you handle being super busy? Do you just wait it out.. If so, whats that like? Do you start leaking at tables? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty much in the dark and all the waitresses at my store have done formula feeding instead of pumping. &lt;/p&gt;

NW: New Waiter DC: ¨Deaf¨ Cook FC: Funny Cook

We had a new waiter and is was middle of the week no clients at all. We´ve decided to have some fun with him. 

Right behind the bar there were 2 windows to the kitchen. First where main dishes came out and the second where salads &amp; Entrée where made but also the dishwasher was nearby.

We told the new waiter to go up to the second window and ask the cook who was washing dishes to ask him for a pot we needed for something.

The guy goes up to the window and shouts.

NW: Hey the guys in the kitchen need the pot clean.

No reaction from DC.

FC: You got to speak louder he is almost deaf.

He raised his voice slightly

NW: Listen DC they really need the pot (spanish olla)

FC: Louder!

DC turned with the back to him: Onion? (Spanish Cebolla) Tell them it´s in the kitchen

NW: Not onion. Pot!

I’ve closed off my schedule for my current restaurant job to only the weekends. It’s going to be a huge change and yes, I’ll lose my weekend freedom.

However, I accepted a new, non food-industry job that pays better and I’m close to home AND I don’t get off by midnight! It’s M-F, and it’s only a five minute drive from home. No more late night bus rides or hot, cheap black uniforms every night.

I’m slowly phasing myself out of the industry and hopefully within a couple months, I’ll be gone completely. I have a love-hate relationship with this industry, as many of us do.

Being in the industry has taught me so much about treating people in the service industry with respect, knowing that it’s a hard job behind the bright smile and the flashy interiors. Tips matter, so I’ll always continue to tip high until one day, employers learn to pay their employees higher wages. I know that’ll be a long ways off, so I’m going to help where I can.

Don’t come in 30 minutes to closing. Be open about a wrong order. Be honest with yourself and customers. This is a hard job and I know many of us rely on it.

I was already broken from standing six hours with no break, running up and down stairs to the mezzanine because Britney NEEDED a glass of water that she couldn't have asked me for when I was just at her table taking a drink order for everyone else. She didn't touch it, of course, wanting to utilize it for the observation of condensation instead.


You sat on the mezzanine, overlooking the bar, watching the three of us scramble to pour beers, run food, wash dishes, and bus tables while our only bartender put on her stone face and chanted, ""not tonight, not tonight.""


I forgot to put in your drinks and calmly (screaming inside) said I'd be back with waters, and that we were backed up. You took it well. Spying the couch and armchair farthest away from the stairs you asked if you could move tables. I'd already put your food in for the table you're at. (Internal banshee noises)


""Sure."" I smiled tightly and sighed.


You ended up loving your new corner and asking me if I was okay. Told me take my time. You got our cocktail with a tiny dinosaur in it and we discussed what it could be (velociraptor, I looked later) and we joked together. Despite my 30,000 steps, endless side eye disappointment and rude gesticulations from the vast majority of my customers that night, you made me feel like I was seen, really seen for the first time, and that I meant something to your overall experience.


After you left, smiles and kind words and encouragement, I got around to opening your checkbook. 


Four $5s, and a handwritten note. 


""Thank you for a pleasant experience! You rock &lt;3""


You saved me last night. Wherever you two are, thank you.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Ok so the place I worked at as the head waiter I had a reputation of being very strict of kinds. I like many of you here for sure just want the work to flow as smoothly as possible and so I expect that from the other waiters too.

While teaching new guys I´m not really that hard on them but can raise my voice a bit during weekend night rush when they screw up things that they should already remember to do (placing cutlery on the table before the food comes out, asking if they need anything, take out their drinks and food from the bar/kitchen to the tables etc)

So this happened after the summer fesitvities in my city and my boss gave me free from monday to thursday as I was busting my ass off for the last 2 weeks non stop making every shift during those weeks and they were trying out 2 new guys cause one of my coworkers left after the summer.

Friday night I have to come at 9pm and I arrived 15 min earlier. I ordered a coke and sat at one of the tables before the rush to smoke and relax before my shift. I notice the 2 new guys standing at the door talking to eachother.

Guy 1: You heard the head waiter will come today?

Guy 2: Yeah. The guys from the kitchen said he is an asshole. I hope I don´t have to work with him outside on the tables

Few notes. We had a terrace area which was split into 2 and required 2 waiters and it was always my area as I work the outside plus the waiting list. Also the guys from the kitchen like to tease with the new guys and fuck with them around.

While I listened to them talking shit about me I said nothing. 8:55pm came round so I stood up, left the empty coke bottle at the bar and pretend to go to the bathroom while I went to the backroom to change into my uniform. Once I finished fully dressed I opened the door to the terrace and stood behind them.

Looking between the gap of their head and with my hands behind my back I spoke out.

Me: Ok so which of you poor souls will work with me today?

They both turned around and see me all dressed up when I was sitting at a table 5 min before.

Guy 2: Are you the.. headwaiter?

Me: Yep. Now go inside and ask the manager who of the two of you is assigned with me.

Ohh the Karma when Guy 2 came out white on his face saying he will have to be working with me. He did quite well and I only mentioned a thing or 2 to him during the whole night pointing out minor details. We all went out drinking that night, kitchen staff included and they were pissing themself of laughter as I told this.

Guy 1 left after a month or so cause he moved to another city while the other guy stayed there until I left and is now the new Headwaiter.

&lt;p&gt;So this happened after the summer fesitvities in my city and my boss gave me free from monday to thursday as I was busting my ass off for the last 2 weeks non stop making every shift during those weeks and they were trying out 2 new guys cause one of my coworkers left after the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night I have to come at 9pm and I arrived 15 min earlier. I ordered a coke and sat at one of the tables before the rush to smoke and relax before my shift. I notice the 2 new guys standing at the door talking to eachother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy 1: You heard the head waiter will come today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy 2: Yeah. The guys from the kitchen said he is an asshole. I hope I don´t have to work with him outside on the tables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few notes. We had a terrace area which was split into 2 and required 2 waiters and it was always my area as I work the outside plus the waiting list. Also the guys from the kitchen like to tease with the new guys and fuck with them around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I listened to them talking shit about me I said nothing. 8:55pm came round so I stood up, left the empty coke bottle at the bar and pretend to go to the bathroom while I went to the backroom to change into my uniform. Once I finished fully dressed I opened the door to the terrace and stood behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking between the gap of their head and with my hands behind my back I spoke out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok so which of you poor souls will work with me today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both turned around and see me all dressed up when I was sitting at a table 5 min before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy 2: Are you the.. headwaiter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yep. Now go inside and ask the manager who of the two of you is assigned with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohh the Karma when Guy 2 came out white on his face saying he will have to be working with me. He did quite well and I only mentioned a thing or 2 to him during the whole night pointing out minor details. We all went out drinking that night, kitchen staff included and they were pissing themself of laughter as I told this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy 1 left after a month or so cause he moved to another city while the other guy stayed there until I left and is now the new Headwaiter. I pop up once or twice a month to have a beer and a few laughs with him&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I'm typing this on mobile, so I apologize for any typos or format issues. 

Let's start with a little background:

I work in an upscale restaurant in a very nice part of town. We never really have any disruptive issues with our guests, even if a server totally botches an order. The only complaints we ever receive is the amount of time it takes for orders to hit the table or that the food is too spicy. It's a really chill and sweet gig. 

About a month ago our sister store on the not so pleasant side was closed down for good. Many of their customers migrated to our restaurant. Servers usually make around $140-200. However, since the closure of the sister store, the tips have been plummeting while the complaints are ridiculous and at all time high. 

THE STORY:

Last night 6 people arrived requesting a table for 10. The hostess immediately sat them and there was an attempt to greet them. When the server approached, before she could even say hello, the guests began order entrees in a very condescending manner. Keep in mind they are still waiting on 4 other people to arrive. After the order was taken the server asked for drinks and was ignored. As she was leaving to put appetizers in and grab them waters things started escalating. You could hear everything that was happening with this table from the kitchen which was just a few feet away. 

Guest 1: WHERE is she going??

Guest 2: I think she's getting appetizers

Guest 1: But she didn't even ask us for drinks!!

*server approaches with tray of waters*

Guest 1: I didn't ask for that

Server: I brought water for everyone. Can I get y'all something else?

Guest 1: *shoves water glass back at server, spilling most on her*  

Guest 3: You didn't even bring lemons? *scoff* Bring me a pepsi.

As the server gets their drinks, she's asking around if anyone else would like the table. She somehow managed to keep her cool after the series of events unfolding. Of course no one would voluntarily take care of that nightmare table. When she brought out the appetizer it was game over for everyone. Guest 5 claims they were given dirty silverware. The odds of this happening are very slim, unless there was a lazy server that didn't care about what they were rolling. I didn't get to see the silverware so I can neither confirm nor deny it. 

In unison, the six of them get up and start heading towards the door, tabs not paid yet. The manager was at the host stand and guest 1 begins to go off in his face.

""Our server was RUDE and our silverware was GROSS. Are you the MANAGER?""

""Yes sir. Please lower your voice and tell me what happened so that we can fix it"" 

""WHAT IS YOUR NAME""

""My name is ___""

""I NEED YOU TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR ME. I'M CALLING CORPORATE""

""I just told you my name. It's ___.  I don't feel comfortable writing it down for you, sir.""

""YOU ARE A FUCKING PRICK!""

""If you don't calm down I will call the police""

""FUCKING CALL THEM. I DON'T CARE""


At this point the manager gets his phone and dials 911 seeing that this guest was going full Karen and there was no calming him down. It looked like it was going to get physical. 

They almost immediately left, and the police arrived shortly afterwards. After they were told what happened, they told us to call them again if we see them in the restaurant so that we can officially ban them. After that incident the restaurant was damn near silent. I hope we never have to see them again.

&lt;p&gt;Uhhh, how was the server supposed to know you have a membership card that was expired for more than a year? Also lady, you&amp;#39;ve been getting a discount on a card you shouldn&amp;#39;t even be getting a discount with. You should be grateful at all that you get it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am 21 and I've worked at this family-owned restaurant for like 3 years. I started out as a hostess and bumped my way up to server. I'm moving to another town, and I really like serving, so I'd be interested in doing it there as well.

I love my job, but the way this place handles things is questionable. I've seen so many servers come in sick and not be able to leave. Today I woke up with a fever, muscle pain, vomiting, and this terrible chest pain. I opened, so I knew I wouldn't find anybody to work for me on such short notice. I asked in our messenger app, but nobody answered. If we don't find somebody to cover our shift it counts as a no call/no show and we get fired. I came in, couldn't even lift up a plate because I was so weak. I had to have another server run all of my food. It hurt terribly to walk because my joints were so sore. A few months ago we had to fill out a contract after a health department inspection. It said if we were sick, we had to call off. Yet, all of us have to come in when we're sick. It was Sunday morning, an hour before my shift, how could I get a doctor's note? I recall last year a year a girl had scarlet fever with a horrible rash and she couldn't leave until our rush was over. I feel awful because our restaurant is very popular with the elderly crowd. I know we are all pretty hygienic and wash our hands, but I feel so guilty.

I understand not wanting to be understaffed - trust me, I know the feeling. We only have maybe 30 tables in the place, and only have up to 4 or 5 servers on at once. Sunday mornings we have 3 servers and one bartender.

I really love all of my coworkers, I enjoy the money, and I love my customers. There's nothing better than pleasing a table.

I told her that I would not be able to guarantee that both parties would be sat at the same time, but it was up to her. She rolled her eyes and said nevermind, It'll just be my family, party of 4.

I tell her I'm happy to add them to the waitlist, and if she's still around, I'll try to seat them near her. For some reason in her mind, me seating her party of 4 meant I would be reserving a table for the rest of her party, and they would skip the waitlist. (We have a large sign that says we do not take reservations on weekends). She starts yelling, arguing, the whole bit.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I recently got a job at a local brewery. For the most part this job was...lets say, *decent*. They were basically a 2-star restaurant posing as a 3.5-star; they wanted the waiters to memorize the ingredients of all the food off-duty, memorize the beermaking process despite literally nobody asking about that, they had tests you had to take after a while or they'd withhold your tips...

Despite all that, 95% of the staff were decent human beings. Except for one. *Jeff.*

First, a little context. They claimed that they'd give you 4 days of training before putting you on the floor. Theoretically, you'd be paid a decent wage during that time, except for the fact that once you started actually working the floor they just combined your untipped wages with your tipped wages, so you're basically working for four days at 3$ an hour without tips. 

Still, you need to train, I get it. 

* Day 1: The restaurant is swamped with customers and they have only one server in the front. I spend the whole day running dishes.

* Day 2&amp;3: Actual training.

* Day 4(really day 3?): They get swamped again, and they decide enough is enough, and give me tables.

* Day 5: Introducing **Jeff!** Note that at this point I should only be on my first day actually being a server, with 2 extra days of training under my belt. He introduces himself by asking me if I'd been telling the truth about being a waiter before, as it certainly didn't look like it.

Talk about an introduction. I was busy, so I didn't have time to respond, but this sets the tone for our subsequent meetings.

Now we're going into the holiday season, so things are *very* busy, and I'm working full time. And while everyone else is supportive and encouraging, Jeff finds it utterly impossible to say anything in a positive way. I'd forget a soup spoon and he'd make it out to be the literal work of satan; meanwhile the kitchen is consistently sending the soup out at 70 degrees and the dishwashing staff are leaving 8 or 9 tubs of dishes in a line, forcing the waiters to basically do everything but throw the dishes into the dishwasher for them.

This culminates in probably the worst day of my life. I'm extremely sick, to the point where talking or moving makes me miserable, but I don't want to leave them shortstaffed, so I mention in passing to a different manager that if someone else wanted my shift, I'd be happy to let them have it, if they wanted some extra cash. Mid-shift, I have a rare 3 minutes where we're caught up, and one of the other servers checks our respective takes, and finds that mine is a full *50%* higher than either of theirs, so I offer one of my tables (that I'd already seated and taken their order) to the waiter with the lowest take, which he happily accepts.

About an hour later, this phenominal *douche* has the gall to come up to me and tell me that I wasn't pulling my weight. Because he heard I was asking to 'take it easy' and have less tables. 

He follows this up by saying that, since I wasn't pulling my weight(remember, +50%!!!) He was going to have me switched to being a busser after the holiday crunch was done. And he still didn't believe I was telling the truth about being a waiter previously.

*Seriously!?*

I very nearly blew up right then and there, but I was tired and sick and didn't have the energy to deal with his *bullshit*. So I kept on going, hit the end of my shift, folded every bit of silverware I knew to find, and asked a different shift manager if I could leave, and he said yes.

I clock out, and this absolute assclown comes up to me and says he didn't give me permission to leave. He sends me back to start folding more silverware, off the shift, using the crappy stuff they keep for the waitstaff. Not only that, but he said that I was going to have a test on the ingredients *the next day*, despite having barely worked there for two weeks, and the official policy being you were tested after a *month*.

I was raised not to be rude. But that night was the angriest, the darkest, I've ever felt in my life. I wrote some very dark things when I finally got home.

I knew I couldn't hurt him in any meaningful way. Nobody would take the word of a new employee over an established manager. And I didn't want to overly burden my actually good coworkers. 

But at this point, I have nothing left to lose. If I'm going to lose my job anyway, I'll do it on my terms.

So the next day I went to the office, told them I was going to work **one** more day, told them everything about the shitty manager, that my leaving was 100% his fault and everyone else was good.

That last day I worked my *ass* off. I worked harder than any two other employees combined. I gave one of my most helpful coworkers a chunk of my tip from the previous day, as thanks. And I left with my head held high.

I dunno, maybe it didn't hurt him at all. But even little things can stack up.

I'm also the only server who is cross-trained as a host and a cook (to give you an idea, I was in line for management before I figured out it wasn't worth the pay). So I've seen and dealt with a lot and have learned to just take the tables as they come and not sweat whether or not you think a table is gonna tip when they get sat. Treat them the same, get them in, get them out. The good and bad tips even themselves out.

Today we had a party of twenty people walk in, and the hosts ask me where we should seat them. Out of habit, from my host training, I ask, ""Would you prefer a table with chairs? Or a few half-table/half-booths? We have a party sitting at one we could use, so it could be about twenty-five to thirty minutes before we could seat you there, but if you want all chairs, I have tables right here."" I showed them the tables in my section where they could clearly already see them. The host of the party asked everyone what they wanted and they said they would prefer to wait, as most of them found chairs uncomfortable.

My manager saw the open tables in my section, saw the party, and asked why we were ""making"" them wait. I told him what they'd told me about wanting to wait for booths to be pushed together, and he told me, ""No, if we have space, we tell them where we're putting them and that's where they'll sit."" This directly conflicted with my ""guest-focused"" training, where you clarify all seating preferences with the party before arranging tables (booth or table, dining room or bar, need high chairs, etc). You ask every table, every time. That's how I was trained.

Eventually the party gets sat, and people are asking me why they're not in my section, even though the hosts and I BOTH explained that we offered them immediate seating at the tables in the front and they wanted the booths in the back. They didn't believe that people were willing to wait for preferred seating (reminder: none of these people have ever done exclusively hosting shifts, not even the managers, so they don't quite get how passionate people can get about a booth seat at a restaurant), and claimed that I wanted to pass them off to another server just because they were black. Yes, they actually said this. When I (unlike other servers) have never turned down a table or seated out of rotation. One of the servers who said this (claiming afterwards that she was kidding, of course), later told me the manager in question agreed with what she'd said about me not wanting a large party because they were black.

I feel like people should know me better than that by now with how long I've worked there. I've posted about this place before and I've felt it getting more toxic, but I've never had it directed at me, so it was really upsetting. Servers feel free to say awful things about guests on the expo line in front of other managers, calling them all sorts of horrible names, and refusing to take tables because of ethnicity and management does nothing about it.

,TalesFromYourServer,"My tables for the evening were a 6 top, 2 top, and two 4 tops in that order. Midway through shift, in walks an elderly couple. My 6 top has four adults, a sleeping baby, and a relatively quiet child; my first four top was dirty leaving my two and last four top. My manager is hosting cause we were busy, on a wait, and the other hosts were either seating or grabbing seats for children.  


I can see that she was attempting to sit them at my open and clean two top, but they were making (and by they, I mean she) this uppity, privileged, I get what I want face while pointing at my open four top. I know my manager and she is not great at hiding her RBF when she gets annoyed. I brace for impact when manager seats them and approaches me...  


Manager: ""The lady rudely told me that they wanted to sit at that table because they ""CaNt SiT NeXt To KiDs.""

Me: ""Oh joy. Maybe I can turn and burn em quick.""

Manager: ""Oh don't worry, i'm gonna clean off the other four top and FILL it with children.""

Me: ""Yeah, hahaha...wait what???""

Normally I am also a big fan of malicious compliance and giving what tables give to me. But there is one important thing I must mention; I also don't like children...here. Most of the time they are sweet and have some forced politeness; unfortunately since its a richer neighborhood, the kids are sometimes hyper and very privileged. Like, two 8 year olds each with Airpods and tablets, screaming they want a Mac and Cheese before I have even finished my greeting. That day alone I got both ends of my no-no danger zones repeatedly wacked by children and was not looking forward to more fuckery.

I go to greet the elderly couple and am hit with, ""Look, we both just want some water and if you can just keep it full all evening that would be greeeeeat."" Dripping with condescension and finished with that weird, squinty, fake smile smile you give when you are telling someone and not asking. 

I grab the waters, walk up to the manager. She see's the fire and brimstone in my eyes.  


Me: ""I'm going to scorch the earth, you salt the wound.""

Manager: ""Heard.""  


They took a sip, I appeared with a pitcher of water. Every few moments I step in with a ""can I take your glass?"" In the meantime, a table of four appears with two very hyper children, manager steps in a seats them right at my recently cleaned four top; coincidentally next to my elderly couple who are looking very annoyed by the new arrivals.

""I am sorry about the noise in here today, soccer kickoff and we are just packed to the brim. Nothing we can do. Doing good on water? Greeeeeat.""

In the end, they tipped me 30% for my ""attentiveness"" and left without a fuss. I told the manager and was pretty pleased with the situation for a moment.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’ve been a host for two months and everyone I work with agrees that I pretty much have it down. Most of the servers I work with are amazing and I couldn’t ask for better coworkers. However just like with any workplace I have a few bitchy or whiny servers. I’ve only ever got yelled at twice. The first time was my second week and a server was stressed and yelled at me for no reason (he admitted that he was being a bitch). I personally think it’s because I was new and quiet, however I did tell him that the next time he has a problem he needed to speak to me with respect. We apologized and he has never disrespected me again.

The second time was today and a server was stressed out but we keep seating her because we didn’t know. She said we should’ve used our intuition and known to put her on hold. She only had 3 tables and we sat her with a 4th (all were 6 tops or less) though and she’s been working there for 15 years. Almost all of our servers even the new ones can handle at least 4 tables some up to 9 at once. I understand that serving is hard and stressful but I don’t think this gives them the right to take all their frustrations out on host (unless the host really fucks up ofc). She came up and yelled at me because we couldn’t read her mind and I bit my tongue. Then she came back up to yell at my other host and I told her to calm down and that I felt she was talking to us in a disrespectful tone which I wasn’t going to stand for. My other host tried to explain to her that she needed to tell us next time but the server ignored her and basically said we were dumb. The other host then just started kissing her ass and apologizing. After a while I went to talk to her again and apologize and we made up. However the other host was upset because I stood up for us and we get paid part of their tips. I honestly didn’t think about the tips thing so I promised never to do it again when other host were on the tip-share with me.

However the most we make is 10/hr on a busy day. I feel like it is not worth it to be constantly getting disrespected and kissing up to people, especially because that isn’t a livable wage. I also feel that money will never be as important as my self worth. I was bullied all through school and went into a deep depression in 10th grade which caused me to lose my will to live literally. After that I didn’t let anybody treat me however they wanted to. I will never be a push over again. I always stood my ground, so maybe this has to do with my feelings. I don’t have the energy to get in a full blown fight with them though. I have never gone past asking for respect. After that I just stop talking if they continue to yell.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I serve tables in a cafe, breakfast and lunch, typically, with mostly older clientele. A lot of older people, sometimes with their grown up kids, and their grandchildren. We're doing a Friday night fish fry for Lent, and I have been selected by my boss (thanks) to serve those nights.

I had a regular come in, and older gentleman with his wife, who is now in an elderly care facility. She doesn't come out much, but they would both come the restaurant regularly with all their kids, grandkids, etc, especially for the fish fry.

They come with their eldest son, we'll call him Keith, and say that there's going to be 6 more joining. So I get a table ready, and take their drink orders for just the three of them. Normally, I would set out waters for everyone waiting, but it was slow that night, so I didn't have to rush-rush things as I normally would, so I took things naturally slow and casually.

Ten minutes go by, and the others still haven't shown up. I go tell them that if they would like to order while they wait for the others, or just wait, whatever. I'm in no big hurry. They just order a couple of appetizers and say they'll order full meals when the rest arrive. 

I bring out the appetizers and let them enjoy it. Shrimp cocktails with a spicy twist. They love it.

Twenty minutes go by, still no family. I ask if they are ready to order, or still want to wait? They say they can wait. I have no problem with that, and go to serve my other tables. My mom comes in. I smile and sit her and serve her food. Not really part of the story, but that's what happened while I was still waiting for the family.

Another ten minutes. The family still isn't here. It's been 45? minutes so far, so I ask again if they are hungry. They are pretty fed up with the rest, since they live right around the corner, according to them. They order their plates (the plates are actually named after them,  Keith's BBQ Shrimp, his recipe) and the potatoes we serve in the morning are named after the last name of the parents.  I bring them their food, and they sit and eat for a while longer. I bring out their complimentary desserts, they pay, and eventually leave.

Then five minutes later, FIVE MINUTES, the family shows up. I've already cleaned up the table and reset everything when they come in. I turn around, recognizing them, and tell them that Keith and their parents already left. 

The son of the parents looks at me, and says... ""I KNOW. WE WERE WAITING FOR THEM TO LEAVE.""

They were tracking them with the apps on their phone, waiting for them to leave, so they didn't have to spend a meal with them.

A lot of older people, sometimes with their grown up kids, and their grandchildren. We&amp;#39;re doing a Friday night fish fry for Lent, and I have been selected by my boss (thanks) to serve those nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a regular come in, and older gentleman with his wife, who is now in an elderly care facility. She doesn&amp;#39;t come out much, but they would both come the restaurant regularly with all their kids, grandkids, etc, especially for the fish fry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They come with their eldest son, we&amp;#39;ll call him Keith, and say that there&amp;#39;s going to be 6 more joining. So I get a table ready, and take their drink orders for just the three of them. Normally, I would set out waters for everyone waiting, but it was slow that night, so I didn&amp;#39;t have to rush-rush things as I normally would, so I took things naturally slow and casually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes go by, and the others still haven&amp;#39;t shown up. I go tell them that if they would like to order while they wait for the others, or just wait, whatever. I&amp;#39;m in no big hurry. They just order a couple of appetizers and say they&amp;#39;ll order full meals when the rest arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring out the appetizers and let them enjoy it. Shrimp cocktails with a spicy twist. They love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes go by, still no family. I ask if they are ready to order, or still want to wait? They say they can wait. I have no problem with that, and go to serve my other tables. My mom comes in. I smile and sit her and serve her food. Not really part of the story, but that&amp;#39;s what happened while I was still waiting for the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another ten minutes. The family still isn&amp;#39;t here. It&amp;#39;s been 45? minutes so far, so I ask again if they are hungry. They are pretty fed up with the rest, since they live right around the corner, according to them. They order their plates (the plates are actually named after them,  Keith&amp;#39;s BBQ Shrimp, his recipe) and the potatoes we serve in the morning are named after the last name of the parents.  I bring them their food, and they sit and eat for a while longer. I bring out their complimentary desserts, they pay, and eventually leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then five minutes later, FIVE MINUTES, the family shows up. I&amp;#39;ve already cleaned up the table and reset everything when they come in. I turn around, recognizing them, and tell them that Keith and their parents already left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The son of the parents looks at me, and says... &amp;quot;I KNOW. WE WERE WAITING FOR THEM TO LEAVE.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were tracking them with the apps on their phone, waiting for them to leave, so they didn&amp;#39;t have to spend a meal with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was aghast. My mother thought it was a joke. I assured her, the tone of his voice told me it wasn&amp;#39;t a joke. He was dead serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please spend time with your family, especially the elders. You don&amp;#39;t know how much time you have left.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Got two recent negative reviews today complaining about ""rude servers"" and how we were ""unhelpful"" because the server who helped them told them that they cannot switch our ramen broth from pork to anything else like beef or chicken...because we LITERALLY don't have any other type of broth besides pork! We literally don't have beef broth or chicken broth ANYWHERE in the restaurant. We specialize in hakata-style ramen (called such because this ramen style originated from the city of Hakata in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan, the defining characteristic of hakata-style ramen is that it uses thin, straight noodles instead of the curly type so that it soaks up the soup via capillary action--hence why if you've ever had hakata-style ramen and you don't eat it fast enough, you often end up with more noodles and less or no soup, because all the soup has been sucked up into the noodles) which is traditionally a tonkotsu ramen! 

I stopped by once to ask if they had any questions and the girl asked me if she didn't want pork could she get beef instead and I told her that yeah, but it wouldn't be a straight substitution, we would still have to upcharge her for the beef because it costs more than the chashu that we put in our ramen, and that while she can substitute the meat the broth would remain pork--they were actually in my section but the other server was adamant on helping them since his section was pretty dead, which I was fine with and plus it was almost time for me to clock out anyway since I had only 10 minutes left before my shift was supposed to end. 


And in their 1 star Yelp review they mentioned getting udon instead but how the broth was pork...except our udon broth is fish-based! It even says so right there in the menu that our udon broth is fish-based!

I ask them if they want a table or booth, they say table so I start to take them to our smallest available table (a 4 top). They stop and sit down at an 8 top saying “we always sit here”. Fine whatever. 

They order and the mom gets a turkey melt, and the son gets the entree buffalo chicken Mac and cheese, and two double bacon cheese burgers one with normal fries and the other with loaded cheese fries.

They finish their dinner and I ask if they want any dessert. The gentlemen (if I can even call him that) orders our largest dessert that I can share with my boyfriend and we’ll both be stuffed. And he eats all of it.

Except I’m not scheduled any shifts next week. Just server shifts. They told me it was going to take a while for me to get real shifts and I was mostly just pick up and a back up bartender. Well I tried picking up a shift and it still hasn’t been approved. 

Recently I got some news from a manager that he’s moving to a different place as a GM and I would always have a spot there (as a server). The place he is going to is seasonal but I would be making $$$ during the season. 

I’m super conflicted because if I go there I cannot be hired back at my current place. I also worked really hard to be moved up but now it seems like I just got moved up because they fucked up and couldn’t keep their promise to me  and they just want me to shut up.

Also... a mass amount of people are about to leave so there is a chance I could take some bar shifts but there’s also a chance they’ll need me as a server. Also we’re gonna get fucked and be unstaffed with the worst managers ever.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work – sorry, *worked* – at a casual upscale restaurant in British Columbia. I was there for a year. I mention BC because employees get great support from the provincial Employment Standards Act (ESA). An employee must be written up three times before there can be a serious threat of termination. The write-up has to be co-signed for it to count. In December, for example, I showed up to work 30 minutes late. It was completely unlike me, and after the shift I signed a write-up. No problem. It was my only documented transgression while working there.

I feel like now is the right time to tell you guys that 2019 was not kind to me. I was attacked and robbed mid-year (court case ongoing) and have been attending two kinds of therapy for my PTSD, and my beloved mother passed near the end of the year from terminal cancer. Her diagnosis came about a month after I was attacked. I tell you this for context, not for sympathy – nobody at my work even remotely knew about what I was going through. I kept everything completely compartmentalized. What I’m trying to say is, my professionalism was not affected.

Anyway, with the arrival of 2020, management decided to really tighten the reins. They were cracking down on everything. With all that going on, my GM and I decided I should take January off (mom’s birthday would have been mid-January). Upon my return, I was inexplicably held to an extremely intensive standard. Turns out giving me that time off put the restaurant through a little strain… ok, not my fault, I was told it was totally fine and even preferable for me to take the vacation. 

My first Monday back was the first snow day in Vancouver where transit was actually running. I arrived at work 4 minutes late, but was the second person in the building after the bartender. My first and second days back, I performed well enough to get decent tips, but management “could tell I was stressed,” so they put me on probation – a conversation for which there was NO record and no co-signage. Furthermore, according to the ESA I mentioned earlier… you can’t just randomly put an employee with only one write-up on probation. At the end of the meeting my GM said “See you Saturday” because that was my usual schedule – Monday, Tuesday, Saturday. Unfortunately, a new manager had been hired in to do scheduling and gave me shift outside my availability, which I missed.

A head office manager calls me on Friday, and when he realizes I didn’t know I was scheduled (again, outside my usual schedule) he says “Don’t worry about it my friend, if your boss needs you she’ll call you in.” 

Here’s where shit goes down. GM calls. I say, “I was called off by an HO manager.” She hangs up on me. I figure out a ride to work and text her that I can be there in 15. She tells me no, just come in for a meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow comes, and I tell her I am having severe anxiety and wish she would call or text so I understood what I was walking into in order to help manage my anxiety and… I get this text.

“Your final paycheck is in the mail. No severance.”

No explanation, no legal justification, and apparently, no severance pay.

I ask to be contacted so the terms of my firing can be properly explained to me. One of the top dogs, a man we’ll call Kevin, calls me a few days later. He says:

“You are an employee, not our emotional responsibility. We don’t care if you signed the warning – if the GM says she spoke to you and there’s no record, it still goes on your file. If we terminate another employee for missing shifts 7 times in 2 months, that has nothing to do with you because that’s our discretion. Speaking about it is actually a breach of the other person’s ‘employee confidentiality’. Look, I’m sorry your mom died and you were assaulted, etc., but that’s not our problem. Take a look in the mirror and take responsibility for your trauma. Our only duty to you is to pay you, if you show.”

As you can tell, Kevin is lovely. I’ve filed with the government and will be demanding severance for wrongful termination. I’ll keep you guys updated.

EDIT: I realized I forgot to address Kevin's statement about my coworker missing 7 shifts, and the unclear wording of that portion of my tale. Allow me to explain. My coworker missed 7 shifts in 2 months with the weak excuse ""my dog is sick."" She was given pass after pass after pass, until they finally started writing her up for her inability to show up to work. 6 days before I was put on ""probation"", this other girl was finally fired. The ESA says that employees must be held to the same standard. Obviously, this is so that everyone understands the terms of employment and what behaviours are acceptable and which ones are grounds for termination. The fact that she was allowed to completely just NOT show up for work 6 times and not be terminated is a completely different standard than the one I was held to. When Kevin mentioned this in his statement to mesh used the excuse ""employee confidentiality"" as a way to cover his ass for inconsistent and unfair treatment of employees. Sorry that I didn't include this originally, I hope this clarifies things.

We usually have 7 severs on the weekends and 1 busser on sundays. If there is no busser then the dirty tables will go untouched for AT LEAST 15 min.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I worked a second job at a restaurant this past summer—one made famous by Tina Fey—to gain some extra cash and fill in days I normally would have been in school. We all know that servers can tend to have miserable jobs and miserable customers, but it’s the regulars that can make or break you. 

So I’ve got this one Karen (with the haircut and all) who calls every morning to figure out the soup de jour. Now the hostess swears that she keeps track of who had her last and rotates to give us as few encounters as possible, but I’m in 4 days a week and I see her 4 days a week. Nobody wanted her table, but I’d try and challenge myself to be extra nice to her and see if anything could be made of it. I always greeted her by name as she entered the building, had her coke, no ice made and ready by the time the hostess had her seated, and I knew her order by heart.

So every day I ask her how she’s doing and she replies, “hi, I’m here on my lunch break so you’ll have to make this quick, I’m ready to order now,” this could go one of two ways, she liked the soup, though it wasn’t the one she wanted (she kept holding out for a fall special that came once every October and would get quite annoyed when we didn’t supply it the rest of the year) so she’d get a soup/salad combo, aka, the cheapest item on our lunch menu. But, there were the days she didn’t like our soups. She made a very big deal about ordering a meatball sub and that she was having so much trouble finding something to order as we had no good soups that day.” Let me remind you, she called at opening, every day, to find out if we’d have a soup she liked, and she only ever ordered the same two meals.

Now, she also knew that it was the same person serving her because I had a bright green ombré hairdo at the time, (she thought it would have looked better if it were purple.) But she continued to act affronted as if she had no idea how to manage not having a soup she liked. Every day she’d leave a half-glass of her coke, no ice, (on which she’d specifically ask for a half-glass refill, we charge for lunchtime refills but not if we’re just topping off a drink to refresh it) and a $1.25 tip. 

Finally, one day, it happened. We had a soup she especially liked, and she wouldn’t be able to make it in for lunch the next day. She bought a to-go container of it, double the cost of her original meal, and almost double the tip.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Over the summer I worked as a host at a restaurant that had a pretty high turn over rate. Their main issue was people quitting, and in my time at the restaurant I only ever heard of one person being fired, and boy is that a story.

So my usual shifts at the restaurant were morning shifts with the odd evening thrown in there every once in a while. This story begins during a particularly slow evening shift. Very little activity at all in the restaurant. Due to this, I was standing at the pass talking with my co-worker and one of my managers when the phone rings.

Me: Thank you for calling \[restaurant name\], how may I help you?

Fired Employee (FE): Is General Manager (GM) there?

Me: Sorry, you just missed him. He's gone for the night. You can leave a message if you want, I think he's in tomorrow morning. If it's urgent, Manager (M) is here.

She hangs up. I didn't think anything of it, just someone looking for our GM and was a little rude about it.

About an hour later, the phone rings again. I answer with the same greeting, and get the same question.

FE: Is GM there?

Me: No, sorry. He's gone home for the night. Would you like to leave a message?

FE: I called about an hour ago and was told he'd be back.

Now, one of my biggest pet peeves as a host (I still am at a different restaurant) is being called a liar. At this particular restaurant I've had my fair share of customers tell the managers that they had called in and that I had told them something but now they weren't getting it, and unless I wasn't sure about something (which I specified every time if I wasn't), I would never tell someone false information. So this kinda peeved me, but in the nicest way possible (sorta) I told her:

Me: Well actually, ma'am, I was the one you were speaking to an hour ago, and I did say that GM was gone home for the night. I offered you to leave a message as well, or you can speak to M if it's urgent.

She's silent for a moment before saying, ""Fine, I'll speak to M.""

I hand the phone over to M and go about my night.

The next day I was working a morning shift. GM was in, but was helping out in the kitchen as we were short staffed. He asked me to take a message for any calls for him and he'd get back to them when it wasn't so busy.

The phone rings, I answer with the greeting.

FE: Is GM there?

I recognize her voice.

Me: He's currently helping out in the kitchen and can't take any calls at the moment. Would you like to leave a message?

As she had the night before, she hung up at this. Whatever, I was over it. I went about my day.

Around the end of my shift a few hours later, the phone rings again. I answer. Yet again, it's FE.

FE: Is GM there?

Me: Sorry, he's busy at the moment. Can I take a message?

FE: When will he be free?

Me: I'm not sure. He's helping out in the kitchen, we're short staffed today. It's starting to slow down but I can't give you a definite time as to when he'll be free.

FE: I'll leave my phone number.

As I'm taking down her number she's slightly muffled, so I have to ask her to repeat a few times. When I read it back to her to make sure I had it right, apparently it was wrong and this bugged her because she literally yelled at me what the number was. I ask her for her name, she hangs up.

I go back to the pass and tell the GM he has a message and explained the situation from today and the night before. One of my co-workers was waiting on food and hears.

Co-worker: She's called like six times today. I answered the phone while you were doing room service runs and it was her like four times.

Me: She yelled at me for not being able to hear her telling me her phone number and refused to give a name.

GM: That must be FE.

He explains to us then the whole story: FE didn't show up for a few of her shifts on the previous schedule. No calls, texts, or emails before or after the fact to explain why she wasn't in, didn't answer any calls from the managers, nothing. So they took her remaining shifts off the schedule and didn't schedule her for the next rotation. This didn't sit well with her so she called the night before (the beginning of our shift rotations) to ask GM why she had been taken off. When I passed the phone to M, he explained it to her, telling her she was fired, and she actually refused to believe him, told him she'd only talk to GM about it.

In total, she called the restaurant 8 times in the run of 24 hours because she refused to accept that she was being held responsible for her actions, or I guess lack of actions, and that just baffled me. How do you tell a manager that you don't believe what he's saying just because he's not the GM?

I really wish I knew what happened with the whole situation. This was one of my last few shifts before I left, and I didn't hear any updates before I left. I hope they kept her fired, but judging by those phone calls she probably wasn't going to let that slide.",t2_2tymal7x,False,,0,False,Fired Employee refuses to be fired,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_fbbgfy,False,dark,,public,1001,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,1001,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583005699.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the summer I worked as a host at a restaurant that had a pretty high turn over rate. Their main issue was people quitting, and in my time at the restaurant I only ever heard of one person being fired, and boy is that a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my usual shifts at the restaurant were morning shifts with the odd evening thrown in there every once in a while. This story begins during a particularly slow evening shift. Very little activity at all in the restaurant. Due to this, I was standing at the pass talking with my co-worker and one of my managers when the phone rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Thank you for calling [restaurant name], how may I help you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fired Employee (FE): Is General Manager (GM) there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Sorry, you just missed him. He&amp;#39;s gone for the night. You can leave a message if you want, I think he&amp;#39;s in tomorrow morning. If it&amp;#39;s urgent, Manager (M) is here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hangs up. I didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it, just someone looking for our GM and was a little rude about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour later, the phone rings again. I answer with the same greeting, and get the same question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FE: Is GM there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: No, sorry. He&amp;#39;s gone home for the night. Would you like to leave a message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FE: I called about an hour ago and was told he&amp;#39;d be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one of my biggest pet peeves as a host (I still am at a different restaurant) is being called a liar. At this particular restaurant I&amp;#39;ve had my fair share of customers tell the managers that they had called in and that I had told them something but now they weren&amp;#39;t getting it, and unless I wasn&amp;#39;t sure about something (which I specified every time if I wasn&amp;#39;t), I would never tell someone false information. So this kinda peeved me, but in the nicest way possible (sorta) I told her:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Well actually, ma&amp;#39;am, I was the one you were speaking to an hour ago, and I did say that GM was gone home for the night. I offered you to leave a message as well, or you can speak to M if it&amp;#39;s urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

Without fail she would complain about something every. Single. Day. According to her our service was terrible/slow/rude/whatever she was upset about that day - yet she was a regular and came in nearly every single day? Go figure.

This particular interaction was the first time I'd ever served her - before I knew what a royal bitch she was. For context, the cafe was small and when it was slower whoever was on would take orders, make coffee and run food/drinks (not really any designated areas as there weren't enough staff in slow times).

He does not have good social skills and believes because he is the manager, everyone should listen to him no questions asked. He wants to be the boss but is a dick so people don’t listen to him, exasperating the situation. The GM and supervisor are really helpful good leaders so people listen to them, and they think the same about him but don’t want to deal with him or the problems he causes so it just goes on.

It semi worked he was a little conscious of speaking to people in a less condescending way but went back to being horrible to work with. The last conversation we had made things worse though. He basically said that because I’m floor staff and part time I don’t care about my job as much as him, so only his opinion matters and that I pick on stuff he says because I don’t like him. That’s not true, most people talk shit about him behind his back the whole time, if I didn’t like/respect him I would just let that continue without letting him know there’s a problem.

I posted recently about Valentines day and although there are days when customers really irk me, I love me some good customers.

I was recently pulled from work until after Wednesday (2/26). I initially was diagnosed with a progressing ear infection (meaning my ears looked slightly irritated due to fluid build up in the sinuses or whatever) and put on antibiotics (2/20). Friday the 21st, I worked and felt like I was dying. Two days later I tested positive Influenza A at urgent care. I get called in thursday the 27th, I haven't had a fever in 2 days and am feeling infinitely better. 

Typical server night ensues, one table left a whole ass mess, the rest were pretty tame. Then I got this glorious table. I see them walk in and they're standing at the podium waiting to be sat. I go up, ask how everyone is doing and one of the young girls pipes up ""Good evening!"" And I thought it was the cutest thing ever. The two kids were around 8 maybe 9 years old. Super polite and well mannered. We chatted about our favorite pizzas and some other stuff that honestly kinda left my brain the second I walked away. 

Anyways, I'm cashing them out and one of the moms tells me ""The girls are so sad they didnt bring their wallets, they wanted to chip in on the tip themselves."" One of the little girls even wrote me a little note, just a simple ""thank you!"" And drew a little kitty face covered in whiskers on the sheets we hand out to kids.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Some quick backstory - I work at a server at a place that may or may not sell mainly large round things consumed frequently at Friday nights. But I'm not just serving there - servers take calls, seat people, cash people out, help run drive through, take orders, serve tables, buss tables, along with a few odd things done later on (clean bathrooms, restock, clean counters, etc).

I love this job. I love interacting with the kids that people bring in, seeing the odd orders people make, seeing whatever random dog someone brought in their car with them - it's great.

What's not so great are a few of my higher ups.

We have four managers, and one even higher up manager. Two of our regular managers are pretty chill, and our higher up manager is also great (he'll take tables if we get swamped, make drinks, seat people, take calls, etc.)

The other two managers, well, they're not my favorite people in the world.

On with the story!

Friday nights tend to be very busy - this was my second Friday night since Valentines day (which is a whole other story and beyond awful for my third day at work) but luckily, we didn't have too many tables the few hours I was working. Calls, however, were going off the hook.

First section we get in was a group of six - no big deal, biggest inconvenience was two people waiting on an order were sitting at our only 8 top.  Our third server wasn't there, and my section is that 8 top + booths only, so I seat them over at our newest server's section. Newest like, I was around the week before for her training. I got a mild scolding over how I turned the tables - it was apparently a fire hazard. I had done it before and nobody had said anything, but sure, easy fix. Fire safety things tend to be a bit odd, so other then a bit confused, I went with it. Made some small talk (apparently a slightly fatal error - I asked when her shift ended).

New server accidentally seats the next table in her section, again. Not a big deal, I just told her I'd take the table since her other was already a larger group. Well, manager was not pleased - she yelled at anybody who mixed sections, ever. (We have two table sections, and one booth section. Which means whoever gets the booths, almost always gets swamped while the two table sections might get 10 tables between them. So none of the servers mind dipping into each other's sections, or picking up tables if it gets too busy.) I told her I was worried about new server having both a larger table and that one as well, and manager told me she would help her out. Spoiler, she never did.

Phones still ringing like mad. Other server comes in. Everybody ends up with a couple tables, and new server did just fine.  Manager decides she needs to have me do everything under the sun, and keeps directing me at things that are anything but dealing with my tables. I even end up working drive through for a bit, which was certainly not my job for the night. Unfortunately, because of that, I forgot to put an order in (my bad), but luckily the couple was understanding. 

Eventually most people disperse to who knows where, after the call volume comes down. Manager two comes yelling from the back, saying anyone who doesn't start taking phone calls is going to get written up (she can only hear the ringing phones in the back, not see that every single available phone up front was being used most the hour). Phone goes off again, I'm working on getting stuff out to a table, and leave it for another coworker to get (who wasn't doing anything). Manager two yells at me for not taking calls, and that calls come first, and my tables can wait. I just kind of ignore it, and carry on.

Later on, I'm out (finally) working on clearing off one of my tables that left. At least one other person was behind the counter when I left, and I had my back turned to it. I was also a fair distance away from it. Manager two comes out and yells at me to get the phone. I answer back that I'm in the back (aka it would take me a moment, and if possible could she or another person take the call. Looking back, I could have said something else, but I also highly doubt she would have treated it any differently.). She leaves, I end up there a few moments later, and take the call. Not a clue where my coworkers had vanished to.

Only a couple ours into my shift, I get pulled aside by manger one, and reamed about my attitude. I'm being written up when I go into shift today for snapping at 3 different managers (including one that I had said maybe 3 sentences to, let alone snapped at). Told me all about how I need to work on my attitude, how I only make the manager's jobs harder, that I need to learn how to multitask and deal with how busy Friday nights were. That a lot of people apply there, and how lucky I was to have my job.

I was in near tears, and while she (very, very slowly) transferred my tables so I could clock out, she had me take customer phone calls. I think I managed to sound marginally okay, although I did have to dart off into the bathroom to cry a bit for a moment. 

I'd like to quit, and after I leave for the summer, I know I'm certainly not coming back in the fall like I had planned to.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I got secret shopped and I vividly remember him because he informed me he was taking food home for his wife and she had a black pepper allergy so nothing could touch pepper in the kitchen or she will get very ill.

So when he arrives, he had no menus on the table which indicates he sat himself (but in the report he said a hostess sat him but he “didn’t know her name”). Then I go to greet him and give him my intro and he was quick to cut me off . I then recommended some apps his wife could eat but when I went to the kitchen I was informed there was pepper so I went back and told him that I couldn’t do that one so I offered steamed veggies.

He agreed to the steamed veggies and I got it sent out first (in the report he mentions he was upset that steamed veggies came as an app). He then orders the most expensive item on our menu and I ensure there is no seasoning at all and he seemed fine. We had shift change so I had to transfer him to another server (who he also failed).

When I read the report he said NOTHING about his pepper allergy I had to work around and said I offered no appetizers when I went out of my way to offer some without pepper. He said I didn’t smile and said I didn’t greet him for 20 mins (which is not true).

,TalesFromYourServer,"Some years ago I worked for a company that specialized in Sushi and basic japanese food, it was a good job but a difficult one made so by the fact all the chefs, managers, and most of the servers were pretty terrible at their job; but they had all known each other for years and kept making excuses to cover one another.

Since I was ""the new guy"" I had the hardest job of all, working the hot food section. Our restaurant worked like a regular sushi place, all the cold food and sushi went on a belt that traveled slowly round all the tables, any hot food orders (and there were a lot of those) were sent to the kitchen i.e me.

I worked that section alone. Even on days when we being slammed and I had so many orders the delay on food was up to an hour long was I always alone, I was also expected to prepare all the sauces, clean the fryers, cook rice and cover the KP when he went on break, I was always alone, even when we had eight other chefs in the kitchen not one could be convinced to help me out, one would spend the day slicing up the fish the rest would be prepping sushi or standing on their phones. Management did not give a shit.

What management did care about was my performance. Reagrdless of how hard I worked it was never good enough and any customer complaints, regardless of context, were often excused as being my fault. The store manager, a read headed 'boss girl' type, would spend hours standing behind me, being over-critical of everything I did.

I worked 16 hour shifts from 6am till 9pm, often 6 days in a row. At 9pm someone else would come in, take over from me, the restaurant closed an hour later and they got the 'reward beer' they would give out at the end of busy shifts. 

 I had worked at a Fast Food place previously so I had been more willing just to put my head down and get on with the job in spite of the fact it was killing me.

I finally did complain several times, no-one cared. Finally after 2 months I became unwell and was disagnosed with muscle strain and fatigue. My Dr informed the restaurant I would have to work less, so they fired me.

The red headed 'boss girl' manager dragged me into the office to explain that not only was I utter hopeless at the three person job I was doing by myself for 16 hours a day for minimum wage, but a customer had complained about finding a hair in her food which had been identifed as being from my beard. Every other chef, cept for one, had long hair and a beard, but it was 'identifed' from my beard specifically, it sounded like bullshit to me, but I didn't complain.

They expected me to finish my 16 hour shift that day, instead I walked out. A few days later I was hired by their rival company across the street, who paid me more, treated me with more respect and I've found a large number of other people who have also previously worked at that sushi place and had the same experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in better sushi place I am 'in charge' of the Ramen section, I've won several in-house awards for my cooking and am generally considered to be one of the best at what I do. Outside of a small incident involing a vegan menu event I really love this job and had generally forgotten about previous sushi place. Until the day we started hiring new managers,

We needed new floor managers, the company had made the classic error of promoting good servers to floor manager levels and it hasn't worked. We need someone with experience and a few have applied.

Today is trial shift day for three of the promising applicants, the first one did very well, even noticed the few traps laid out by managerment to try and catch slackers, the second was nervious but did ok, but when the time for the third applicant comes in walks Red Headed 'boss girl' from previous job. She greets everyone, scans along the kitchen line at all the other chefs, then her eyes meet me. In my different coloured hat showing that I am at a sous chef level, with the several awards I have won pinned into the side. I give her a smile and a wave, she dead-pans stares at me for a lot longer than necessary before marching off to greet the manager.

Her trial ends in failure. Not only is she slow and unable to direct the staff; barking confusing orders and getting over-stressed at everything, she also cannot perform at a basic server level, cannot pour drinks and runs food like a clumsy 1st timer.  It was a privalage and an honor to hear the other servers complain non-stop about her inability and general agressive nature remembering how difficult she had made things for me at my previous job and the bullshit she had made up to get me fired. 

Her trail ended early, she was politely thanked, and we never saw her again. Manager came over to me after he heard I had previously worked under her and asked for an opinion. I gave him my honest one, told him of my time working at \*other\* sushi place and the fact I still have back problems from it, he nodded, trashed her résumé , and that was that.",t2_og1gl,False,,0,False,Is there anything more satisfying than seeing an ex-boss fail a trial shift?,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_faeqgu,False,dark,,public,3952,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,3952,,True,self,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1582850175.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some years ago I worked for a company that specialized in Sushi and basic japanese food, it was a good job but a difficult one made so by the fact all the chefs, managers, and most of the servers were pretty terrible at their job; but they had all known each other for years and kept making excuses to cover one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in better sushi place I am &amp;#39;in charge&amp;#39; of the Ramen section, I&amp;#39;ve won several in-house awards for my cooking and am generally considered to be one of the best at what I do. Outside of a small incident involing a vegan menu event I really love this job and had generally forgotten about previous sushi place. Until the day we started hiring new managers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed new floor managers, the company had made the classic error of promoting good servers to floor manager levels and it hasn&amp;#39;t worked. We need someone with experience and a few have applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is trial shift day for three of the promising applicants, the first one did very well, even noticed the few traps laid out by managerment to try and catch slackers, the second was nervious but did ok, but when the time for the third applicant comes in walks Red Headed &amp;#39;boss girl&amp;#39; from previous job. She greets everyone, scans along the kitchen line at all the other chefs, then her eyes meet me. In my different coloured hat showing that I am at a sous chef level, with the several awards I have won pinned into the side. I give her a smile and a wave, she dead-pans stares at me for a lot longer than necessary before marching off to greet the manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her trial ends in failure. Not only is she slow and unable to direct the staff; barking confusing orders and getting over-stressed at everything, she also cannot perform at a basic server level, cannot pour drinks and runs food like a clumsy 1st timer.  It was a privalage and an honor to hear the other servers complain non-stop about her inability and general agressive nature remembering how difficult she had made things for me at my previous job and the bullshit she had made up to get me fired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her trail ended early, she was politely thanked, and we never saw her again. Manager came over to me after he heard I had previously worked under her and asked for an opinion. I gave him my honest one, told him of my time working at *other* sushi place and the fact I still have back problems from it, he nodded, trashed her résumé , and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So the new restaurant I'm at has an extremely strict ""take your break"" policy. Which shouldn't be an issue and actually something that I should be extremely happy about. 

Here's the thing. Even if we are extremely busy, line at the door, management will still make you take a break and leave the other servers to suffer. So instead of doing that, now they make us take a break an hour after our shift even starts. Yesterday I started at 9, and had to take a 30 minute at 10. I talked to the other servers about it and they just told me that they are super cheap with labor hours (surprise surprise) and they will take any opportunity to not have to pay you for something. The reason they make you do it so early is so they can get it over with so everyone can just work through the rest of the shift. 

I find myself just sitting and watching the other servers making money, and getting overwhelmed while I could still be out there helping and making money. I'm used to working my server shifts straight through without breaks because that's how It's always been at my other restaurants.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I worked at this breakfast franchise downtown over the summer. It was pretty disorganized but I worked with a friend and it could be fun. One Saturday morning ( busiest and hottest day of the Summer) during  the beginning of a 10 hour double, 4 girls walked in. They looked like trashy off brand Cardi Bs with attitude. One server had the section they sat in but he said he didn’t wanna serve them as they probably were the bad type. I said I’d take them since you can’t judge a book by its cover. I later came to regret that decision. I get them water and ask to take their order. 3 of them weren’t ready and told me to come back. The 4th one looked like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed and ordered me to take her order. She wanted an appetizer of chicken wings. She said she wanted chicken wings and scowled when I didn’t know what that meant. I asked before putting in her order and told her we don’t do that since it comes prepackaged and ready to cook with a mix of flats and drums. Before I finished talking she immediately asks to talk to my manager (who told her the same thing) and I take drink orders. When I get back with drinks she demands to know where he food is. I never put the order in since she talked to the manager and assumed she didn’t want them anymore. She said if it’s not mostly flats, she’d send it back to the kitchen. She also demanded that they come out before the entrees( like duh, it’s an appetizer). She ate 2 plates and demanded they be free because they weren’t to her liking. The girls ordered their food and she requested a specialty drink which takes a while to make so I couldn’t put in everyone’s order plus I had other tables. She wasn’t happy about the 5 minute wait. When she got her food she threw it on the floor because « the broccoli was raw ». We steam out vegetables but she didn’t say she wanted it sautéed when I asked. She asked me if I was new because « I wasn’t very good at my job » and said that it wouldn’t be long before I was fired. I was really over her and her friends since they just let her be rude without telling her to chill. While dealing with her, I lost a table since I was to preoccupied with her bs to look at the tablet and they changed table sections. Still I smiled, got them their many rounds of drinks and tried to be as nice as I could even though I knew she was giving a tip at that point. They were there for over an hour so I was just waiting to leave their check. Everytime I passed their table, she looked irritated, even if I wasn’t greeting them and just getting other orders. When I was getting dishes from another table she called out and told me they wanted their check. I already had it ready in my pocket but my hands were full and no one else was ready. I collected the cups from there table and told her I’d be back with their checks. She instead decides to throw her money on top of the dirty dishes I’m holding and loudly says I’m not getting a tip so I need to bring back a receipt. I was so fucking mad but I had to keep the smile up. I had to get her cash out of a pile of spit out food in the Dish room. My manager said I should’ve just thrown it out with the food. After that , I returned with the actual check and she was mad because I handed her the wrong one (as if there’s not 3 others I had to give out) and asked for her change. My restaurant doesn’t keep a lot of change so we just round to the nearest dollar. I gave her the cash and she screamed at me over the 4 cents she was owed. I ran around looking for pennies and she continued to berate me. All together their bill was around 200$ and I made 9 dollars in tips from the other 3 so everyone kinda sucked. I was so fucking glad when they left. She’d also made a mess between the spilled food and her drink that I had to clean( low on bussers) but I was just relieved.

I work with an older man named ""Bob"". He's about 70 years old and definitely should be retired at this point. Our owner hired him because they're best friends for like, 40 something years, to a host position. Bob and I are the only two full time hosts. I absolutely hate him and so does the rest of the staff. He is sexist, petty, throws tantrums, and is completely unable to do his job. I spend almost all my shifts with him fixing his mistakes. He also can not be fired because he's the owners friend. Although I absolutely hate him for a multitude of reasons, too long to list in a single post, I'm going to post the most recent drama he's caused at work. 


At the very beginning of the day, before we open, the servers polish and stock any remaining silverware from the night before. Then, until close, the hosts are in charge of polishing and restocking the silverware for the servers. We also use a small supply we keep at the host stand to make individual roles of silverware for less formal tables. At the end of the day, after we close, any silverware left over is racked and cleaned by the servers. This is how it has been done at this restaurant for over a decade. No one has had any problems with this system. Until Bob. 


Please also note that the hosts keep silverware stocked at the actual host stand for the convenience of a certain sections so servers do not have to walk almost to the back of the restuarant to reset their tables


Bob decides that servers are no longer allowed to take silverware from the host stand because he has decided that would be for silverware roles only. He promptly tells all the servers this (which they ignore). He also proudly announced that he oh so graciously polished a rack of silverware for the servers, and had done them a huge favor. Bob absolutely knows this is part of our job description so I have no idea why he said this. Then, a server (R) kindly brings up a fully racked and cleaned supply of silverware for him to polish and put away. Bob freaks on him telling R to take it back to the kitchen because it's not his job to polish the rack, and he's already rolled enough silverware, therefore he didn't need more silverware. Bob also states it's not his job to supply silverware to the servers and told R to do it himself. 


R then asked Bob if he enjoyed being paid to do nothing, among other things. 


Bob went crying off to our GM (this man is 70+ remember) about being picked on and bullied by R, and how he's not going to polish the silverware, and basically stating he's not going to do his job. 


Now we have notices at literally every wait station and kitchen notice board explaining the system of cleaning silverware. R was not written up and everyone got a hearty laugh out of what he had said to Bob. Bob called out today claiming to be sick but we all know he's just sulking.

R was not written up and everyone got a hearty laugh out of what he had said to Bob. Bob called out today claiming to be sick but we all know he&amp;#39;s just sulking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested I have probably a hundred stories to tell, like how he assaulted me, how he treats guests, and how he pretends to be the owner.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I worked for a brewery/slightly upscale restaurant. It was late afternoon, just before AM-PM shift change. A slightly older couple, maybe late 40s-early 50s comes in. They sit in my section and go straight to the menu. I introduce myself, which they have little interest in. The husband order a coke and the wife a water. I grab the drinks, return and ask if they’re ready. They respond with “we’ve barely looked at the menu.” Annoying but not a problem considering it’s relatively slow. After about 5 minutes I return to the table to take an order. The wife asks me why we don’t have a tomato basil pasta dish on the menu that she saw online. I explained to her I know the dish she was describing but it has since been taken off our menu maybe 6 months prior. She went on to tell me how she recently became vegan and saw an article online about this dish and came there specifically for it.

Fun fact about this dish, the tomato basil sauce was made with cream, and it also was made with prosciutto, so not at all vegan. 

I told the woman, however, that I had good news for her. We were one of the only locations to have created a fully vegan menu and I would be more than happy to bring that and discuss her options. She was not happy about that answer. She insisted she came here for only that item and that the article she read said we would have it and she even saw a picture of what it looked like. I asked if she could show me the article so I could understand where she was coming from. She pulled out her phone and showed me. The first thing I noticed was the article was from 2 years prior (when the item first hit the old menu) and the 2nd was that the picture shown wasn’t even of our food. 

At this point I realize I should have tried to get my manager, but I’ll get to that in a second. I explained to her the article was outdated and the food shown wasn’t ours, but that seemed to infuriate her. She stood up and got in my face claiming I have been nothing but rude and dismissive of her and her husband and they would be leaving. I tried to apologize if I came off that way I was sorry but she said I didn’t mean it and demanded to see my manager, which I said I would grab him. I went looking in the office, the kitchen, the back bev station, the closed dining room, and the brewery, this man was nowhere to be found. The woman starts shouting for me asking where he is and I say I’m trying to find him, as I am rushing through the building. She storms out with his business card from the front, and my manager comes out from the employee bathroom, seemingly taking a very long and inconvenient dump. 

This woman writes in the next day saying how rude and unhelpful and arrogant I was when all she wanted was a simple dish she looked forward to trying. I re-explained everything to him, but he gave me a write up anyway saying I should have gotten him involved... I don’t know what could have been done differently.

We have a self serve breakfast bar and people like to hide sausage patties under their scrambled eggs or hide hash browns on their breakfast sandwiches. You can’t make this shit up. 

So, we decided the best course of action was to put a sign at both cash registers, “You MUST open your box at the register.”  I literally had a customer laugh in my face and say, “You know, people wouldn’t feel the need to steal if y’all didn’t jack up the prices!”

That’s like saying, “Why make laws if I’m just going to break them?” I stared at her blankly and responded, “I’m pretty sure people stealing stuff is their OWN fault. Don’t be a sneaky jerk and we won’t have any problems!”

,TalesFromYourServer,"Howdy Reddit! I wanted to share something that happened to me a few weekends ago and that I couldn't get out of my head because of how stupid it was.

For this story, it is important for you to know that there is a small foyer with a wardrobe at my workplace right before the main area where people sit and eat. The restaurant is mainly bottom-to-top windows, but the foyer is sectioned off by actual walls, so you can barely figure out what's going on in there if no one is actively looking. Oh, and we have a disclaimer written on a sign at the wardrobe that our restaurant is not liable for stolen items. See were this is going?

Cue a family of four a few weekends ago.  Mother, father, two sons, not necessarily friendly when we greet them but not obnoxious or rude either. Yet. They are seated at a nice window place close to my section, so I don't serve them, but can see what's going on and what they're doing. Not much of note happens during their stay, except that they are being increasingly rude and demanding to my colleague who's serving their table, without her having done anything wrong. On one occasion they complained about their food being too cold (even though it was still effing STEAMING), another time they call me over from my section all the way across the restaurant for another order of drinks because supposedly my colleague was ""ignoring"" them - I saw her come by the table to ask for refills literally two minutes earlier. We have these obnoxious types from time to time, and they are the worst, especially when the children take after their parents and behave the same disrespectful way. Some other minor things come up, the whole family gives us death stares for their entire stay and leaves no tip on a 60$ bill. They pack up their things and leave to hopefully never return to our restaurant. Except they do. One minute later. This is were I get to experience these people in all their glory.

The mother storms back in, through the foyer, the older son in tow. I worked the section next to the foyer, but it was quite a busy day so (naturally) I didn't have my eyes on the wardrobe all the time. 

Mother: Our umbrella is missing.

Me: Excuse me?

Mother: My son's umbrella is missing and I know someone stole it. I want you to take care of it immediately.

Me: I'm sorry someone took your son's umbrella, most likely someone else mistook it for their own. That happens from time to time. There is not much I can do about it at the moment. Maybe someone-

Mother: I don't care, we want the umbrella back. It was your responsibility to keep an eye on it, so you need to fix this right now.

Me: Again, I'm sorry, but our restaurant is not liable for the wardrobe and there is a big sign that states the same right at the entrance of the foyer. Sometimes things get mixed up and people bring in items they accidentally took with them a few days later. The same could have happened with your umbrella. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few tables to tend to. You are more than welcome to check if someone brought back your umbrella in a day or two.

Mother (muttering to her son): Yeah whatever..

I race back to my tables because I've been held up for way too long. Take a few orders, bring out some drinks and so on and forth to people, when I notice that the mother is still standing at the entrance after five minutes , brooding. So I head back, because quite frankly, she's blocking the entrance and I just want the have her out of my face at this point. 

Me: Excuse me, but is there anything else I can you with? Because if not, then-

Mother: I'm taking another umbrella. 

Me: Uuuuh.. What? (my genuine reaction) 

Mother: Since my son's umbrella was stolen I'm going to take another one with me. He can't go to school without it. 

Me: Madam, you can't do that. 

Mother: Oh, I can. We came here with an umbrella and we are leaving with an umbrella. 

She then hands me an umbrella out of nowhere and gives me a demanding stare. 

Mother: Go ask your guests if this is their's. If nobody says yes, we are taking it. 

Me: You want me to ask every. single. table. in the restaurant if that is their umbrella? 

Mother: I don't see why that's a problem. 

Me: Your umbrella was stolen and you want me assist you in stealing another one in return? That's hardly legal. 

Mother: I didn't say anything about stealing! This is compensation. And my son needs his umbrella! 

Me: Madam, I won't help you take someone else's property. I'm sorry you are missing an umbrella but there is nothing I can do for you. You are free to check in a few days if someone returned the umbrella, but besides that, nothing can be done. Have a nice weekend. 

She tries to protest, sees my manager approaching and just tells me ""you can bet I will be back on Monday"". With her son in tow, who starts to throw a fit about his umbrella while they leave, I check that they don't help themselves at wardrobe with yet another umbrella, and return the one umbrella she audaciously demand as ""compensation"". I share the story with my manager, we have a good laugh and wonder if that woman will ever return. 

She did not come back for her umbrella, but an umbrella looking suspiciously similar to the one she tried to steal was returned to us on Thursday the week after. I wonder who could possibly miss it.

I wanted to share something that happened to me a few weekends ago and that I couldn&amp;#39;t get out of my head because of how stupid it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this story, it is important for you to know that there is a small foyer with a wardrobe at my workplace right before the main area where people sit and eat. The restaurant is mainly bottom-to-top windows, but the foyer is sectioned off by actual walls, so you can barely figure out what&amp;#39;s going on in there if no one is actively looking. Oh, and we have a disclaimer written on a sign at the wardrobe that our restaurant is not liable for stolen items. See were this is going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue a family of four a few weekends ago.  Mother, father, two sons, not necessarily friendly when we greet them but not obnoxious or rude either. Yet. They are seated at a nice window place close to my section, so I don&amp;#39;t serve them, but can see what&amp;#39;s going on and what they&amp;#39;re doing. Not much of note happens during their stay, except that they are being increasingly rude and demanding to my colleague who&amp;#39;s serving their table, without her having done anything wrong. On one occasion they complained about their food being too cold (even though it was still effing STEAMING), another time they call me over from my section all the way across the restaurant for another order of drinks because supposedly my colleague was &amp;quot;ignoring&amp;quot; them - I saw her come by the table to ask for refills literally two minutes earlier. We have these obnoxious types from time to time, and they are the worst, especially when the children take after their parents and behave the same disrespectful way. Some other minor things come up, the whole family gives us death stares for their entire stay and leaves no tip on a 60$ bill. They pack up their things and leave to hopefully never return to our restaurant. Except they do. One minute later. This is were I get to experience these people in all their glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother storms back in, through the foyer, the older son in tow. I worked the section next to the foyer, but it was quite a busy day so (naturally) I didn&amp;#39;t have my eyes on the wardrobe all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: Our umbrella is missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Excuse me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: My son&amp;#39;s umbrella is missing and I know someone stole it. I want you to take care of it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m sorry someone took your son&amp;#39;s umbrella, most likely someone else mistook it for their own. That happens from time to time. There is not much I can do about it at the moment. Maybe someone-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: I don&amp;#39;t care, we want the umbrella back. It was your responsibility to keep an eye on it, so you need to fix this right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Again, I&amp;#39;m sorry, but our restaurant is not liable for the wardrobe and there is a big sign that states the same right at the entrance of the foyer. Sometimes things get mixed up and people bring in items they accidentally took with them a few days later. The same could have happened with your umbrella. Now, if you&amp;#39;ll excuse me, I have a few tables to tend to. You are more than welcome to check if someone brought back your umbrella in a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother (muttering to her son): Yeah whatever..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I race back to my tables because I&amp;#39;ve been held up for way too long. Take a few orders, bring out some drinks and so on and forth to people, when I notice that the mother is still standing at the entrance after five minutes , brooding. So I head back, because quite frankly, she&amp;#39;s blocking the entrance and I just want the have her out of my face at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Excuse me, but is there anything else I can you with? Because if not, then-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: I&amp;#39;m taking another umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Uuuuh.. What? (my genuine reaction) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: Since my son&amp;#39;s umbrella was stolen I&amp;#39;m going to take another one with me. He can&amp;#39;t go to school without it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Madam, you can&amp;#39;t do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: Oh, I can. We came here with an umbrella and we are leaving with an umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then hands me an umbrella out of nowhere and gives me a demanding stare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: Go ask your guests if this is their&amp;#39;s. If nobody says yes, we are taking it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: You want me to ask every. single. table. in the restaurant if that is their umbrella? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: I don&amp;#39;t see why that&amp;#39;s a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

I found a job at one of the only other restaurants in the area. It's a little bar and grill. We have a small staff. We have 7 servers and 2 full-time bartenders. I bartend one day a week.

I have a lot of regulars that come in three, four and five nights a week. They have told me that they want me to serve them when they come in. For example, I was bartending on Monday night for the first time. I was getting the regulars more beer and they weren't at the bar. We weren't busy and there was no excuse for the two servers. They're just lazy and inattentive. I had two regulars last night ask me if I am working tonight.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Serious question, if that's allowed. I've been serving for about 6 years and more recently have had a job at a higher end restaurant in my downtown area where there are quite a few homeless people living. 

A guy walked in yesterday and was sat by my manager, he had a huge backpack and to me, without negative judgment, he appeared homeless. He was courteous to me the whole time. I never treat anybody differently when serving them because I've found that people surprise you going both ways based on their looks. Anyways, he orders, he eats, he walks out. My manager followed him outside, but he was gone, I'm not sure what they would have done if they had found him.

I feel bad and think he probably doesn't enjoy walking in to a place and not paying, but he also needs to eat. There are shelters and places all around downtown where they have food for free, if he had even asked for food or said he couldn't pay, we have tons of employee meal I would have given to him. I don't want to insult anyone by asking, ""can you pay for this?"" at the beginning, but if they can't, then maybe we can move forward and they can still get a meal without stealing from a business.

What would everyone else do in this situation? I don't have to pay for any walk outs at this job, so no loss to me other than my time.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hi there! So I've been working as a barista for the last 6 months and absolutely love it, especially the dealing with customers (and getting tips) parts. Problem is, the money is just not there, and I want to move on to a place where I can really take advantage of my social skills and get bigger tips, rather than just get a portion of the tip pool (and people don't tip all that much at a coffee shop anyways).

Is there a best time of year to make that move? A sweet spot around when patios/terraces open for the summer but students are in finals and haven't scooped all the jobs yet. I'm in Montreal so all the patios are closed for the winter. Besides the money, my current job is really nice, I love my boss and coworkers. On the one hand it feels like the kind of jobs I'm looking for are starting to pop up now, but maybe I feel that way because I am looking more often now. On the other hand, if I could choose, I'd like to stay in the same spot until April, which would put me in a better financial situation to make a move, and would also be when students are in exams.

They sat, my husband walked towards them with menus and they proceeded to get up and walk right past him, he literally had to step aside to let them pass, again no acknowledgment of his existence. 

They then walked into our other room which was set up for a group which had pre-reserved and pre-ordered, and then asked if they could sit in there. We explained that I would just have to move a table around for them and they promptly sat on the group table, set for 20!

We explained that this was exactly the table which was reserved, eye-roll followed. There was a reserved sign on it. I moved some furniture around and put their table together, they reluctantly moved over to this table. They have still not said hello or made any eye contact.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Sorry, was too lazy to post for a while. Anyways, on with the show.

The setting is summer time, hottest day of the year so far, hottest time of the day in the early afternoon. I distinctly remember it being Father's Day. It's 40 degrees out, no one wants to be outside in the blazing sun. Except for one pair: a man and his grown daughter.

I'm the only server on at this point. I give them menus, get drinks and water going for them right away. All seems well at first; they're friendly. 

Finally, it's time to order. The daughter orders a fish dish, the father orders a steak dish (if you'll recall, I work at a popular steakhouse) and asks for it chicago medium rare. I attempt to give the gentleman our standard warning: when the bright sun is out, it affects the colours of the steaks. What looks red/pink inside doesn't actually look red/pink outside. 

He interrupts me and tells me not to worry about it, he's grilled many steaks outside in his backyard, he's well aware of how steaks look outside. I say great, but I still remind him he should just taste his steak before getting concerned. At this point, I'm feeling confident that all will go well.

Finally, their mains come out. After a couple of minutes, I go out to check on them. The father immediately tells me the steak is overcooked \[insert mental facepalm\]. I attempt to remind him about the sunlight and he interrupts me: ""I cook steaks all the time. I know what they're supposed to look like. This is not medium rare."" I then ask him to maybe try a bit of it first and if it's still not to his satisfaction, I'd get him another one. He refuses and says he KNOWS it's not medium rare.

So, I take his plate back inside. As soon as I cross the threshold, his steak immediately looks red-pink inside the doors. I know this steak is cooked just fine, but I go get my manager. She sees the same thing I do, but she can't/won't argue with him. So, she gets the chef to cook another one, but this time she has him do it chicago **blue rare to rare**.

She takes the dish back out to him and has him try it. He thinks it's perfect. For the rest of their dinner, he tells me -- in the most condescending tone imaginable -- that he knew his steak was cooked wrong, and THAT'S how a medium rare steak is supposed to be cooked (i.e., the almost blue rare one), and I shouldn't have questioned him. It took every ounce of willpower I had not to throttle him and then tell him the truth.

&lt;p&gt;He interrupts me and tells me not to worry about it, he&amp;#39;s grilled many steaks outside in his backyard, he&amp;#39;s well aware of how steaks look outside. I say great, but I still remind him he should just taste his steak before getting concerned. At this point, I&amp;#39;m feeling confident that all will go well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, their mains come out. After a couple of minutes, I go out to check on them. The father immediately tells me the steak is overcooked [insert mental facepalm]. I attempt to remind him about the sunlight and he interrupts me: &amp;quot;I cook steaks all the time. I know what they&amp;#39;re supposed to look like. This is not medium rare.&amp;quot; I then ask him to maybe try a bit of it first and if it&amp;#39;s still not to his satisfaction, I&amp;#39;d get him another one. He refuses and says he KNOWS it&amp;#39;s not medium rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I take his plate back inside. As soon as I cross the threshold, his steak immediately looks red-pink inside the doors. I know this steak is cooked just fine, but I go get my manager. She sees the same thing I do, but she can&amp;#39;t/won&amp;#39;t argue with him. So, she gets the chef to cook another one, but this time she has him do it chicago &lt;strong&gt;blue rare to rare&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She takes the dish back out to him and has him try it. He thinks it&amp;#39;s perfect. For the rest of their dinner, he tells me -- in the most condescending tone imaginable -- that he knew his steak was cooked wrong, and THAT&amp;#39;S how a medium rare steak is supposed to be cooked (i.e., the almost blue rare one), and I shouldn&amp;#39;t have questioned him. It took every ounce of willpower I had not to throttle him and then tell him the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never bit my tongue so hard before or since that man.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, my coworker was talking about how he can’t whistle. I was telling him how I couldn’t wink as a kid but I would try so hard because my Grandma (RIP) used to wink at us all the time. It was a quirk of hers I still vividly remember (she died when I was 15 and I’m almost 32 now).

,TalesFromYourServer,"I used to work at a place in downtown Austin, TX. We had a big patio out front with a pretty garden on the other side of the walk. Since it was a restaurant, we tried to keep any critters from living in the garden; we already had enough cleanup to deal with from the pigeons and grackles. We were mostly successful until a juvenile opossum moved in. He was pretty bold but relatively harmless, so we didn’t really hurry to find a solution to his living situation. At first, he mostly stayed hidden until after closing, so the owner put out a few traps and we hoped for the best. The little fella was too smart for that, and the traps remained empty. 

One morning while we had the doors propped open to receive a delivery, our breakfast server walked up to me and whispered that we had a customer in our gift shop who needed me. I followed her to the front room and there he was, little Mr. Opossum, checking out our selection of handmade local jewelry and crafts. We quietly shooed him out the door before any guests saw and we hoped that would be the end of it. 

The owner redoubled his trapping campaign that week, but again, the marauding marsupial was too smart to get caught. He knew he had it pretty good in our garden and he was making every effort to maintain his tenancy. 

Around this time, Mr. Opossum also decided that the patio that the humans were all sitting on wasn’t so scary after all. More than once during a dinner shift, servers spotted the little freeloader searching for dropped food among the tables or climbing the railings. Again, he would be quietly shooed away so our guests didn’t notice him. 

The next week during our big delivery, he wasn’t found in the gift shop, instead he bypassed it and went straight to the dining room. We knew he had to be stopped. He had gone too far.  But what to do? He’d eluded every trap we put out. We couldn’t poison him because who knows where his stinky carcass would end up? And we really didn’t want to kill him if we didn’t have to. Many of the staff had gotten attached to him and we didn’t want a full on mutiny over one eight inch marsupial. 

We had an entire manager meeting that focused on the possum problem, and by the end of it, I had convinced the owner that the catch and release plan I came up with could work. It would require the entire team’s cooperation, but I was certain my bleeding heart coworkers would be on board if it meant saving Mr. Opossum’s life. 

So, in our evening pre shift meetings that week, I reviewed the plan with the FOH staff. I coached the BOH staff as well, as they would be needed too. I bought extra brooms and staged them near the patio doors. And we waited each night for our little buddy to show himself until the night when one of the servers came running in from the patio to tell me the time had come. 

“Guys! You all know what to do! Commence Operation Opossum!”

The FOH dropped whatever they were doing, the kitchen spared who they could to assist, and my team of Opossum Wranglers all grabbed their brooms and proceeded to herd Mr. Opossum toward me as I waited with an empty bus tub. 

It was a tense few minutes. Mr. O. zigged! He zagged! He ran up a drain pipe and was turned back in the nick of time! He deftly climbed the baker’s rack we used as a server station and almost got away but at the last minute Alecia knocked him off right into the waiting bustub! 

Along with the staff, our customers who witnessed the incident broke out into applause as I secured the lid on the tub. (Thankfully our patrons were entertained and not grossed out!) I handed over my keys to the bartender with strict instructions not to burn the place down while I was gone, and I headed to my car with the tub. 

I drove Mr. O. to the lake that runs through downtown and released him near a stand of bushes I’d picked out days earlier as the best spot to give him a fighting chance. And thus ended a time that I will always remember fondly both for the compassion of the folks I worked with and the cuteness of the critter for whom we had to find a more suitable accommodation.

Four top of two couples, they're nice enough. They start with waters then one person from each couple orders beer. They all look under 30, you know the drill.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So this, my friends, is a story of a time of a busy lunch I had. In my restaurant there are no hosts, just servers trying to greet everyone. but we get busy.  We don’t always spot people at the door. Bartenders get too busy to greet too. And managers as well. We’re part of a hotel so we’re always busy doing something cross related.

So most of the time it’s sort of understood, you can grab a table and wait for a server. People are pretty understanding. 

i was busy this one lunch grabbing a coffee for someone and when I came out i saw two new ladies at my table. Imagine two middle aged ladies with suits on. They were attempting to order with the busser, who had a very confused look on his face. Our busser’s english aren’t great and they are not comfortable with orders. 

I jumped in and waved him away with a smile and he looked relieved.

Lady One is brunette with short hair, a little quiet but sporting a frown like she had been paralyzed that way. 

Lady two is a bit younger with blonde hair and flaunts a sickeningly evil smile. 

I can smell something bad already. 

Me: Hello there ladies! So sorry, I was helping another guest but I can help you now. He’s not a server so unfortunately isn’t trained to take your order. Can i take it again?

Lady one: No. *turns her head away*

Me: Uh... haha! Um, if you don’t mind just giving me a rehash so I can put it in real quick!

Lady one: *head is still turned away from me*

Lady two: We already gave it to him, and we’re in a hurry.  And make sure my salad doesn’t have dressing. 

Me: Which salad is that? 

Lady two: You can ask him what we ordered.

Me: Miss, I need to take your order myself. If you just don’t mind telling me?? 

they both stare at me. just stare. and... I’m done with it. so I just smile and go, okay! 

I speed walk to my manager through the weeds of our restaurant jungle. 

I find her and explain what happened. She is a little topsy turvy stressed from her duties. She goes okay and heads to them. I see her talking and she walks back to me. I ask her what’s up? What did she say?

Manager: Oh they’re fine, they said they’re just waiting on food?

Me: Noooooo!!

I explain what happened again in more detail.

Me: And then they refused to confirm their order with me!!! They’re not waiting an order because no one put it in!!

Manager: oh. OH. 

My manager seems to wake up. She rushes over to them and next thing I know, I see the ladies angrily getting up to leave.

My manager throws me the thumbs up sign and I walk behind them to make sure they leave. Lady number two is walking by the tables and loudly saying what a disgrace this establishment is, what a embarrassment.

I wave goodbye and cheerfully smile at them.

Me: Bless your heart ladies, have a great day outside today.

It was pouring rain outside.

That’s it. That’s the story. Just simple sweet justice.

A lot of the times, with certain managers you’ll see a different outcome. You worry that the customer will end up being “right” even when they’re wrong.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I just got this email from the restaurant I work at (Illinois). Please tell me if this is normal/legal/ridiculous or am I just being dramatic:

""Here is this weeks schedule from \[owners\].

To further manage our Food &amp; Liquor Costs, we are instituting a new policy starting this Tuesday 2/25/2020 regarding miss fires/ wrong orders / loss of revenue opportunities for our server and bar tending staff.

Examples are, but not limited to these: failure to place an order into the system allowing it to then be late and therefore requiring \[owners\] to remove that from the bill will now be a full cost to the server. If a wrong order is entered and prepared that requires a new order made, that incorrect order will be a full cost to the server. If an extra cocktail, wine or beer is prepared it is the responsibility of that server to make aware to the bar tender that item(s) has been served. If a customer waits too long for service for drinks or food due to circumstances within their control, the cost of that lost revenue will be to the server. (ie: ignoring a table due to talking to another table too long, in the back eating, on your personal cell phone, talking with other staff members)

\[Owners\] have instituted a system that allows you to not make these mistakes, for example: The tickets coming from the front register, allows you the opportunity to review what has been entered and make any adjustments prior to fire.

Please tell me if this is normal/legal/ridiculous or am I just being dramatic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here is this weeks schedule from [owners].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further manage our Food &amp;amp; Liquor Costs, we are instituting a new policy starting this Tuesday 2/25/2020 regarding miss fires/ wrong orders / loss of revenue opportunities for our server and bar tending staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples are, but not limited to these: failure to place an order into the system allowing it to then be late and therefore requiring [owners] to remove that from the bill will now be a full cost to the server. If a wrong order is entered and prepared that requires a new order made, that incorrect order will be a full cost to the server. If an extra cocktail, wine or beer is prepared it is the responsibility of that server to make aware to the bar tender that item(s) has been served. If a customer waits too long for service for drinks or food due to circumstances within their control, the cost of that lost revenue will be to the server. (ie: ignoring a table due to talking to another table too long, in the back eating, on your personal cell phone, talking with other staff members)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Owners] have instituted a system that allows you to not make these mistakes, for example: The tickets coming from the front register, allows you the opportunity to review what has been entered and make any adjustments prior to fire. Further- Under the law, restaurants have the right to dock servers pay for mistakes such as described above including walk outs. However, we also know that docking the pay for these mistakes can not go below the federal minimum wage which we will calculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fine dinning restaurant sourcing high end food which makes mistakes costly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Howdy ya'll. I've posted before about the sushi counter I serve at. When I got this job I was really optimistic about it- the place seemed super chill and I got along well with managers and coworkers. So I'm very disappointed in how much of a shitshow it turned out to be.

During my first week, I noticed a few cockroaches  (should have been red flag #1). I was assured that these had come from another restaurant in the strip mall that had recently closed, and we're being dealt with. Months later, they are only getting worse. Customers are noticing, and another server told me they had been there for years. Last week I was sweeping behind a booth and a WHOLE ASS NEST of like 15 roaches came running out. 

This is a franchise based in Japan, and corporate has recently tried to improve profits by raising prices and making serious staffing cuts. They cut our dishwasher, leaving dishes to the cook and server. Since I am the only server with formal serving experience  (should have been red flag #2, but I figured everyone starts somewhere), I work alone on weekdays. I also host and bus, and there's never enough time to actually give good service. Our Google reviews are low, and every day there's a customer complaint about slow service, even though I'm busting my ass all day every day. I'm getting the feeling I was hired as ""damage control"", because none of the other servers are skilled or experienced enough to handle that many people. I'm being called in at least once a week on my day off because using me as a backup is better for the bottom line than actually scheduling enough people. When I do have another server on weekends, I'm constantly picking up the slack while they spend 20 minutes doing some unnecessary task in the back. We've raised our prices but are too cheap to order new menus. We also started charging for everything from to-go boxes to sauce to extra chopsticks. I am constantly being accused of lying about prices because management raises them without telling me. I've been staying an hour late every night to finish dishes, because everyone else just dips at our scheduled time off and leaves them for me. We have shared tips, so understaffing and apathetic coworkers mean I'm barely making half of what I was promised, but doing twice as much work.

Because of all of this, I decided to put in my notice. My manager seemed genuinely shocked. I explained to her that there are cockroaches everywhere, customers are upset, and the stress of everything being a constant emergency is bad for my mental and physical health. Her response? ""Well I guess I can't stop you, hope you change your mind."" Really?!? You aren't concerned about a bug infestation? About your reputation being trashed online because your policies make service terrible? That you can't keep qualified staff? I've never been so disappointed in management before. I might have stayed if they would have at least offered to work on any of these things, but now I can't wait to get out.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hi guys, first time posting here but been lurking a while. Wanted to see if anyone had any advice for me here. 

I work at a pretty well known steakhouse as a server and it’s not a bad gig. I make decent money and I don’t have too many Karens so overall pretty solid shifts. I don’t work all that often (1-2 nights a weeks) and I’ve been working there for 2 years.

My problem is that every single time that I’m scheduled for a night shift, I have extreme anxiety for the entire day leading up to it. I don’t generally have anxiety and if I do I can usually keep it under wraps, but not so much in this case.

,TalesFromYourServer,"  

So this is going to be a long one with a bit of backstory. Lets get into it.

I manage a cake shop/cafe, we specialise in ready-to-buy birthday cakes. We are a very small store, pretty much from every corner you can hear whats going on out the front. We also have a camera view of the entire shop front with a viewing screen out the back. So I saw and heard everything in the lead up to my encounter with the customer.

Just over a week ago on a Friday (a very busy day for us), a lady came into the store to buy a birthday cake for her son, should be a very normal situation. I don't usually pay attention to whats going on front of house, because that's what the service staff are for, I was busy out the back making custom cake orders for the weekend. But my ears perked when I hear her asking for discounts on the products in the display case (our display is always full of fresh cakes) the cake she ended up picking was only finished and ready for sale about an hour before she brought it. I had a bad feeling she was going to be a problem customer, so I was getting ready to go out to speak with her if needed, but she ended up happily getting the cake after being told the cakes were fresh and we had no discounted cake today by the service staff.

That's the end right? No.

About 3 hours later my co-worker ( Ill call him D from hear on) takes a call. I didn't hear both sides but D was explaining it to me as the conversation was going on, I was elbow deep in cheesecake so i didn't just grab the call myself

'So this lady is saying she brought a cake earlier today, after she got home she ate a sprinkle out of the box that fell off the cake and says its disgusting, she wants a full refund or a replacement cake because she thinks the sprinkles are stale.'

I tell D to ask her what it tastes like and to explain sprinkles are just condensed sugar a colouring (they don't taste great on their own) and the batch in question was delivered fresh to us just 2 days before.

She asks D to promise we will replace the cake.

He explains we cant promise that, but we would be happy to come up with a suitable solution for her if she could bring the cake and her receipt back into the store so we could understand what was going on. She screams at him over the phone, it couldn't understand what she was saying but I could hear the screaming coming from the phone. She hangs up before anything else could be said.

20 minutes late I see her enter the store with the cake box in hand (she will be called crazy cake b\*tch CCB, from hear on), D goes out to try to help CCB. He opens the cake to see CCB has jammed her own pirate decorations and candles in to the cake roughly. The tops destroyed, some of the frosting is squished onto the side of the box and the 'Happy Birthday' writing on top is damaged.

We have a pretty firm refund policy. Once a cake has left the store it can not be refunded for change of mind. And we are not meant to allow foreign objects into the bakery (her pirate decorations).

After going through CCB's complaints again, D offers to directly fix the problem, remove the sprinkle and replace them with a new layer of cream and chocolate flakes or different sprinkles of her choice, free of charge for her troubles. He also offers to fix the other damage she caused, free as well.

This is not good enough. CCB yells at him that its 'bullshit' and 'Its not good enough, the sprinkles taste like shit, I need a replacement cake or a full refund'

D says he needs to talk with the manager and asks for her receipt, she doesn't have it. D brings the cake back to show me.

CCB is angry and I want to deal with this as cleanly as possible, so I call the owner and ask for advice. The owner thinks the customer is shit talking to get freebies, but agrees it would be better to have this end cleanly, tells me to give CCB a half refund and offer to still fix the cake and give it back.

I take the cake back out to her and explain what I can do, I make sure i'm as kind and apologetic as possible

At this point she has been in the store for 7 minutes total, the store is also full of other customers.

She still complains its not good enough, and asks why I cant just give her a full refund AND a brand new cake.

I say ""I'm very sorry, it has left the store and has had object put into it so we cant take it back. The sprinkles are fresh and there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with it, I'm sorry you don't like them, we are more than happy to replace them and refund half the money for the trouble.""

The cake is on a little bench between us. Our conversation has lasted 22 seconds.

I see a look come over her face and she say under her breath ""Y'know what.."" and she grabs for the cake

I think 'Oh, she's gonna storm out'

Nope. CCB opens the box, lifts it open and brings it cake down on me at full force.

Just some perspective I'm a 5'6 medium build, mid twenties female. CCB is at least 6'1 and rather large.

I'm lucky that i'm quick enough to get my hands up to stop the cake so it doesn't come down on my head, but of course its a light sponge cake with cream, so it breaks up and showers all over me and the shop floor.

CCB immediately legs it out of the store. D comes from out the back, having seen it from the security camera screen and follows her to the parking lot. And takes a picture of her and her car. D says she tried to run him over getting out. Another customer also follows her and gets her licence plate as well.

I'm still standing there covered in cake, in front of a shop full of customers. I excuse myself out the back, take off the cake covered apron and hat, wash it off my arms and face then go out to apologise to the other customers in the store. and start cleaning the floor. The panic starts to settle in me and I start feeling a strained pain in my right arm where I took most of the force of the cake box hit. My brains still pretty foggy so I don't think to call police or security.

This is an insane story as it is but it just gets worse.

Not even half an hour later, i'm still cleaning cake from everywhere btw, D takes a phone call from our Regional manager, ill call him RM (its a Franchise, we are singularly owned but governed by a head office). RM is furious, and demands we will be giving CCB's husband a full refund, saying its now company policy that we give out refunds no matter what. D ask if he's heard the full story. RM says ""No, I don't care, give the damn refund, husband will be in to pick it up in 20 minutes"" Then hangs up. When D tells me I Immediately try to call back, no answer, so I call my store owner. Owner is pissed RM stepped in to do that, but tells us to comply for the moment because if she was violent before, we don't want to aggravate the husband.

I have no clue how they contacted RM so quickly, the only people with access to his number are employees, my best guess is she went to a store in the franchise and lied her way to getting them to call him.

Pretty much on the dot, the husband comes into the store, he's quite and takes the money from D, we get him to sign a from saying he's taken the money. Just as he's about to leave, he shouts back ""So this means you'll delete the picture?"" D says No husband repeats ""You'll be deleting the photos""

I walk out the front (stupidly I now realise) and say ""I wont, they're going straight to the police""

Husband looks me dead in the eye, points at me and says ""If you do, ill be back, and it wont be cake you'll be cleaning off the floor"".

I shout back as he's leaving ""Now I can add threats to my police report!"" stupid courage is apparently a symptom I get when scared.

I finished up everything I needed to and updated the owner and asked for her to download and send me the cctv. And I headed to the police station to make a report. No way am I letting them get away with treating people like this.

I made that initial report that day and was going to come back with the cctv the next day. But ohh it gets crazier! I get a message through our store Facebook from someone who knows CCB, including screenshots from the CCB's Facebook of her bragging about the entire incident, she goes as far as admitting to the assault and admitting to getting her husband to threaten physical harm if we went to the police.

So I took all of that to the police too! As well as going to the doctor to get my arm checked, he recorded elbow and triceps sprains, damage and swelling. Also got him to make a note of emotion stress and anxiety from the threats

The investigator thinks it will go to court for assault, but i'm still waiting to hear anymore from them.

I've barely slept this week, my arms getting better quickly, so that's good at least. I'm so paranoid everyday at work that they'll come back or find where I live. But I couldn't stay quite and let them get away with it.

Ill update if anything new happens. Its been really nice to get this off my chest and write it down. I would love to post the footage with this, but I'm worried it could effect the case.

Quick update:
I went back to the doctors, I have soft tissue damage  in my right arm from my elbow to my shoulder from where I put my arms up to defend myself. Ive also been pull on light antianxiety medication/sleeping pills to try and get some rest. 

Ive also been in contact with the police, apparently CCB and husband have been dodging calls and not answering the phone. They say cctv and the social media posts isnt enough for them to be charged with out the opportunity to give their side of the story. But if they dont answer soon a warrant will be put out for them and their car.",t2_56ayy6g9,False,,0,False,"Customer assaults me after eating a single sprinkle off her cake, doesn't like it, damages the cake and demands a full refund.",[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_f90si6,False,dark,,public,404,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,404,,False,self,1582957512.0,,[],{},,True,,1582617278.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is going to be a long one with a bit of backstory.

RM is furious, and demands we will be giving CCB&amp;#39;s husband a full refund, saying its now company policy that we give out refunds no matter what. D ask if he&amp;#39;s heard the full story. RM says &amp;quot;No, I don&amp;#39;t care, give the damn refund, husband will be in to pick it up in 20 minutes&amp;quot; Then hangs up. When D tells me I Immediately try to call back, no answer, so I call my store owner. Owner is pissed RM stepped in to do that, but tells us to comply for the moment because if she was violent before, we don&amp;#39;t want to aggravate the husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no clue how they contacted RM so quickly, the only people with access to his number are employees, my best guess is she went to a store in the franchise and lied her way to getting them to call him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much on the dot, the husband comes into the store, he&amp;#39;s quite and takes the money from D, we get him to sign a from saying he&amp;#39;s taken the money. Just as he&amp;#39;s about to leave, he shouts back &amp;quot;So this means you&amp;#39;ll delete the picture?&amp;quot; D says No husband repeats &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll be deleting the photos&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk out the front (stupidly I now realise) and say &amp;quot;I wont, they&amp;#39;re going straight to the police&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Husband looks me dead in the eye, points at me and says &amp;quot;If you do, ill be back, and it wont be cake you&amp;#39;ll be cleaning off the floor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shout back as he&amp;#39;s leaving &amp;quot;Now I can add threats to my police report!&amp;quot; stupid courage is apparently a symptom I get when scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished up everything I needed to and updated the owner and asked for her to download and send me the cctv. And I headed to the police station to make a report. No way am I letting them get away with treating people like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made that initial report that day and was going to come back with the cctv the next day. But ohh it gets crazier! I get a message through our store Facebook from someone who knows CCB, including screenshots from the CCB&amp;#39;s Facebook of her bragging about the entire incident, she goes as far as admitting to the assault and admitting to getting her husband to threaten physical harm if we went to the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took all of that to the police too! As well as going to the doctor to get my arm checked, he recorded elbow and triceps sprains, damage and swelling. Also got him to make a note of emotion stress and anxiety from the threats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigator thinks it will go to court for assault, but i&amp;#39;m still waiting to hear anymore from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve barely slept this week, my arms getting better quickly, so that&amp;#39;s good at least. I&amp;#39;m so paranoid everyday at work that they&amp;#39;ll come back or find where I live. But I couldn&amp;#39;t stay quite and let them get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ill update if anything new happens. Its been really nice to get this off my chest and write it down. I would love to post the footage with this, but I&amp;#39;m worried it could effect the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick update:
I went back to the doctors, I have soft tissue damage  in my right arm from my elbow to my shoulder from where I put my arms up to defend myself. Ive also been pull on light antianxiety medication/sleeping pills to try and get some rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive also been in contact with the police, apparently CCB and husband have been dodging calls and not answering the phone. They say cctv and the social media posts isnt enough for them to be charged with out the opportunity to give their side of the story. But if they dont answer soon a warrant will be put out for them and their car.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I've been working at a restaurant for a steady period of time now. I was lucky to be hired since I am not from this country and I had no experience in the food industry; I just needed a job. I was warned from the beginning from workers that were leaving that the boss has a tendency to build up resentment against workers for no legitimate reason and have it come to a head badly. Well, I think that's what's happening now.

At my last shift there were three of us: two on the floor, one behind the bar (me). It was quiet but then we blinked and every single table was full. We had just switched to a new cash register system that I personally found easier, but the waiters on the floor were still not used to it and were therefore very slow with putting in drink orders and food orders. Not only was I behind on drink orders because of just how many tables were ordering and how complicated some orders were, but the waiters on the floor took a very long time at the cash register while food orders were beginning to come down. I took some food orders out myself but in general when someone works the bar our goal is to make sure they don't leave the bar too often and I was already behind on drink orders and glass polishing.

The boss came down several times throughout my shift and was picking on me specifically. First he made a point of showing that I was neglecting to take down tickets because this was a minor detail, affected only me, and I had a million other things to do. Then he scolded me for keeping things like napkins and dirty food on finished plates I was sending up, which was never an issue before. One of the waiters and I were scrambling to clean up after the other waiter that was making more mistakes than either of us but we were getting the most flack for it regardless.

After work was done, he called me up and accused me of not caring about the job, of sitting around and doing nothing, of making the shift harder for the other two. He didn't give me a chance to even explain myself, saying that since I've been working this long and still can't be independent, he's going to be taking away some privileges. He did the same thing to the other waiter that was working harder but not to the waiter that was screwing us up the most.

I know this is the industry, but I'm very frustrated by the fact that he assumes the absolute worst of me and doesn't trust me enough to tell him what I think went wrong, especially since I was on the floor the entire time and witnessed everything.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hey guys, I have a dilemma and need advice. 

I work off the books at an Irish dive bar/restaurant. I’m a server. I get paid only $20 per shift w/o tips. I do this job because it’s the only place that would hire me and is around the corner from my house and kids school. So, if I need to pick up my kids it’s convenient. I can also take my kids to work if my husband is stuck at work, which happens a lot. 

This is my dilemma... The restaurant was shut down because this past Sunday the bartender/owners niece had her babies baptism party at the restaurant. Our boss told two other Waitresses to come in at 10am to decorate the entire restaurant. The girls worked from 10am-6pm, I came in at 1pm until 9:30pm and cleaned the party stuff afterwards. Me and the other two girls served (catering style) hors d’oeuvres from 1:30 until 2:30, set up the buffet at 3:30 set up for the dessert table at 4:30 and we served drinks to about 100-150 people from 12-6 supposedly at $35 a head. Some of the customers tipped us 3 girls and we pooled around $42 each. Our shift pay was $40 each, so we each left with $82 each not including the tip from the event. The next day each girl was left with just $100 each which was the tip from just the party. In your opinion is this a fair tip? I feel offended. Especially since it was a tip from a coworker, but I feel like I worked and made nothing. I don’t even like this girl and we aren’t friends enough for me to work for free for her.

Valentines is a very busy day for every restaurant. Young couples, old couples, people who want to have a time with just the two of them—-and when you have 7 groups of 2, tables full out really quickly and suddenly the entire store is filled and the servers are running around trying to manage it all.

A group of 6 came in on Valentine’s Day to the sushi place I work at. Backstory of the day: 1 chef (also my boss), 2 servers (including me), bathroom flooded earlier. Half the kitchen is a cm in water. So needless to say, it was stressful. This group of 6 came in and I explicitly warned them that the food was going to take a VERY long time. I work at a mom and pop sushi shop. The owners aren’t very keen on business, and we offer AYCE at 27.95 a pop. This means people tend to order HUNDREDS of dollars worth of food for 27.95 each.

In my opinion, if you’re having good food for 27:95, please quiet down and be patient. Because that’s what the MAJORITY of people do, especially groups. It takes forever to make all of those back-kitchen orders and those 26 piece AYCE nigiri sushi that you ordered.

This group of 6 was led by a she-ogre of a matriarch. I’d say we were working well. We were getting orders out as soon as we could and we literally could not control the speed of how they were being made as we had a full house in an establishment that never has more than 5 tables at a time. She was getting very rude, was talking at me instead of to me, was very demanding with her food. “We didn’t get served this!” Yes, you did, I’m pretty sure I know the menu and what you ordered at a place I’ve worked at for 8 months, on a sheet of paper that clearly marks what you want. “The orders are too long!” That’s because you and your family ordered 10 things from the back kitchen, around 30 pieces of nigiri (2pcs), and 7 fancy rolls. It’s gonna take a long time, love. In any case, I was very polite until the very end.

By the time they wanted to leave, the other server was giving them their check and informed them that we add a 18% gratuity on groups of 6. Groups tend to eat us out of our food and tip as though they didn’t just devour two large salmon imported from Scotland and five McDonald’s meals worth of sushi. A 50 dollar tip on 6 all you can eat orders is because we have to clean up the spill your spawn left on the floor, the beer s you leave on the table, your filthy food that’s stuck to the chairs and the table, we clean all of that. We have to touch that. We have to make up for your lack of manners by making it look like we didn’t have a dump truck leave organic waste on the table. It was bad. Like a farm animal’s trough, rice and soy sauce absolutely up the wazoo. So she was mad, “I’m not paying tip for this terrible service!”

Listen, Dear Mrs, our service was good. And honestly? The rolls didn’t even come out that late. We were PRIORITIZING the group and getting their orders out relatively quickly compared to other tables. We have ONE kitchen staff, and we made this clear BEFORE we sat them in case they wanted to change their mind. And, you’re expecting speedy service on VALENTINES day? Are you absolutely empty in the mind? I sigh and I’m exhausted. Two hours. I was solo for two hours because my co worker was mopping flooded floors nonstop. Two hours of nonstop rotations of customers. Apologizing, checking up, refilling drinks. Taking the food to the back, cleaning it. We ran out of plastic cups and had to use glass. It was a shitstorm.

She saw that I was very exhausted and she was angry and pissed and looking like a baboon’s ass. “Give me your name!”, and I refused. “I’m not comfortable. Why?” “So I can YELL at you!”

It stressed me out insanely. I was exhausted, I wanted to go home. “Please,” just, so tired and done with her childish tirade.

Don’t come to an AYCE sushi place with 6 people on Valentine’s Day; we quite literally don’t have the Roman Army it takes to please you at your every whim. Sorry. The world doesn’t work like that. “Please.”

In the end, she wrote “WORST SERVICE EVER!” As if I give a single shit. I’ve quit that job looking for something better. When things like this happen, it’s alright to feel angry and frustrated. It’s alright to feel dehumanized and disrespected. You’re not any lesser for having those feelings still. As you work and move on, your tolerance for bullshit builds up. This is just a rant. This whole exchange, between the store flooding, full time in college, food, and just life expenses, soured me for days and I still get stressed thinking about it. I was threatened to get screamed at for a singular sigh behind the waitress counter as I rung them up. $400 of food for $27.95. On Valentine’s Day. In a store full of couples, you bring your family and expect food within 15 minutes.

The childish entitlement of some of these people. Unbelievable.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Background: I used to work at a college bar with a separate ""game room"" with our pool table that we generally put larger parties in (seats about 40 but theres a ton of standing room and we have pop up tables). 

I was working a Sunday morning/afternoon shift by myself (I was bar and tables until about 2pm because it'd generally be slow). A man walked in just when we open at 11 and said he had a group following behind him. I showed him to the game room and asked what size his party would be. I get a shrug and ""not really sure"". So I ask for a rough estimate because I'm the only person serving front of house and we have one guy in the kitchen. He says maybe 40? 

It's not ideal in the very least. I let the guy in the kitchen know and pull all the tables together to seat 40. 

In walks 75 people. Parents and a bunch of dolled up kids headed to a dance competition no where near campus. I rush to put up more popup tables. Kids and parents all sit separately and everyone orders seperate entrees and everyones on seperare checks. I call my manager begging to get another person in the kitchen and someone else in front of house because my resturant is filling up too. No one answers. 

The guy in the kitchen ended up calling his brother in to the kitchen (he doesnt work for us but what do I care in the moment) and the food is coming out as fast as it can. I have parents complaining that they're almost finished eating but their kid doesnt have their food yet. I tell them we're working as fast as possible but we aren't a large staff and they didnt make a reservation. My main resturant tables are suffering and some people have (rightfully) walked out. 

When it's time for this party to pay parents are saying ""i have that blonde kid over there"" like that means anything. So I hand every adult and child their own check and tell the kids to give their tab to their parents. Parents are furious that I cant put their kids on their check. Theyre furious that I charged the 50 cents for ranch. They're furious I let the kids order extra fries. Theyre furious I'm not paying more attention to them and their problems.

Everything with their meal was good and they were all very nice to me and thanked me a lot but the guilt ridden anxiety side of me feels it was definitely personal.

There’s a girl who has been there a lot longer than me, and no one can stand her. She’s rude, she’s bossy, she oversteps. One of my managers (who yes shouldn’t have been bitching to me about his employees but it somewhat involved me) told me it’s a repeat issue with her. She’s hostile towards everyone and she cares only about how much money she can pull in to the point that her scores are suffering because she steals other people’s tables, gets too overwhelmed, and neglects her customers. Every comment on her sheet is a complaint. 

Yesterday she had a table she basically took on and then ditched them. I ended up having to help them the whole time and every time I went to her to tell her “table 1 needs...” she would interrupt me mid sentence and just bark at me and be hateful. 

I had been there for an hour and she came up to me and said “finish up your tables you’re cut me and (other coworker) will take over the floor”. I was like.... no. I had had ENOUGH. I went up to my manager and asked why they were cutting me so early. He said “what? You’re definitely not cut!” I told him what happened and he rolled his eyes and said “of course she did”. When she walked by she said the same thing to me but thank god it was in front of him. He interrupted her and said “I have NOT cut anyone. At all. NO ONE IS CUT. I will cut people when I am READY TO CUT PEOPLE”. 

I know she has bills to pay but so do I. I have tried to stay really easy going but I’m sick of it. The manager will be bringing it up to the GM at their next meeting but no one ever gets fired from there so I doubt she’s going anywhere and she’s ballsy enough to have rolled her eyes at my manager when he told her he hadn’t cut anyone so I highly doubt it’s changing.

Just for some clarification, I’m a hostess and a waitress. On this night I happened to be just hosting (I just sit people and clean the common areas and check people out when they’re done).

Me: Excuse me, do you need to be seated ?

I take him to a different part of the restaurant and try to  sit him in a clean booth with a server that’s less busy

Me: oh I’m sorry I can seat you somewhere different but it’s going to be a little farther away

He doesn’t say anything so I start walking toward the next clean section and I try to sit him at another clean booth. He takes one look at me and then the table, he doesn’t exactly yell but he did raise his voice in an angry way

,TalesFromYourServer,"Please bear with me. I am not a server, never been, I like reading in here since I eat a lot in restaurants and like to try out new places with my SO (I'm from Switzerland)

So, I get it, in the US you are paid minimum wage (a few dollars per hour), you make your money from the tips. I get that.

Here is the question that I asked myself many times. Even though I also was in the US many times for business and ate a lot in restaurants. Every time i tipped, this question popped in my head. 

Let's say I am in the US and eating out.
I order a Steak, a salad, vegetables and a bottle of wine - total 70$
So I am assumed to tip 7-15$ (i guess?)

So the next day I go to the same place again.
I order a Steak, with a salad and vegetables, but this time I choose a very expensive bottle of wine - total 150$
Now I am assumed to tip like 15-30$

But here is what I don't get.
The server has the same effort he needs to put in. Why am I supposed to tip according to the total amount of my meal, when most of the time, for a simple meal, the effort of the server is the same - regardless the price.
I read many times where servers rate the tip according to the total amount of their bill. 

I don't want to sound cocky or ignorant. I really would like to know. Is this cultural or is this because if someone eats expensive food he should afford to tip more?
Please note, I am not talking about the tip in general, I get it that. I would like to know the oppinion of the servers according to my sample.

P.S.:
Oh, and why some of the restaurants in the US value the customer so much and offers dicounts if they throw a fit (just to have something taken off the bill), is someting I don't understand neither. Makes me really feel bad for the servers over there. But this is a question for another time.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Okay so firstly I’m still kinda new to serving (been in restaurants for 3 years, but only been serving for 1) so I might have been able to handle this better. But it got me fuming.

I had a huge party yesterday, and they tipped and treated me like crap, and left with a few of their credit card slips so I had to 0 them out, so I was kinda burned out on parties today. Got sat a 12 that turned into a 16. That’s fine.

They’re at 3 different tables, 2 for adults and one big one for the ‘kids’ ranging from anywhere between it seemed 15-20. One of the adult tables tells me when I ask that their whole table will be on one ticket, and I say great. As I’m asking the kids who will be paying for them or who might be paying for themselves, one of them, maybe 19 or 20, says he’ll be with his mom, who’s sitting at the table that will all be on one check. I say great!

The service actually goes pretty smoothly, they’re polite, and understanding when the kitchen takes a minute because we got slammed. After desert, a few of them, including the mom and her son, get up and leave as I’m handing out the checks.

Lady from the table who’s all on one check comes up and says: hi, I’m sorry, but I didn’t order these chicken tenders.

Me: oh yes, one of the gentlemen from that table said that he was going to be part of your bill.

Lady: um well IM the one paying so you really should’ve asked me. Who was it?

Me: uhh... the kid in the black jacket? I’m pretty sure he just left.

Lady: well, you really should’ve asked me. I’m the one paying, I even told you that (she didn’t), this is unprofessional.

That table ended up stiffing me, and that entire table glared daggers in my direction until they all got up and left. The rest tipped okay, but not enough to make up for a stiff on a $70 tab.

I’m so done with big parties honestly. I’ll make sure to be asking who’s paying and confirming who’s on their ticket from now on. But honestly, if you can’t communicate with your party, I don’t think I should be the one getting yelled at at the server station.

&lt;p&gt;I had a huge party yesterday, and they tipped and treated me like crap, and left with a few of their credit card slips so I had to 0 them out, so I was kinda burned out on parties today. Got sat a 12 that turned into a 16. That’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re at 3 different tables, 2 for adults and one big one for the ‘kids’ ranging from anywhere between it seemed 15-20. One of the adult tables tells me when I ask that their whole table will be on one ticket, and I say great. As I’m asking the kids who will be paying for them or who might be paying for themselves, one of them, maybe 19 or 20, says he’ll be with his mom, who’s sitting at the table that will all be on one check.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I used to work at this place for about half a year and the number of infuriating stories has provided me  with great talking points at parties for the last year, so at least it got that going for it.  Pretty much everything about this place except my co-workers was a total shitshow. The place is a small Café and Icecream shop in a part of Berlin that is mostly inhabited by families, owned by an Electrician who has no goddamn clue about how to make food or coffee. I've worked as a barista before, and I really take pride in making the best coffee I possibly can. First day there I tried to make a Cappucino and pour some latte art, then proceeded to wipe the steam wand like always. I noticed that they used low fat milk which is shit for making good foam, and the dose of espresso was way to low, so it didn't have any crema and was super watery. I later suggested to the boss that 3.5 fat milk would be better and offered to take time after work to adjust the machine. He shot me down and said they've always done it like that. Well, pisspoor coffee it is then.   


Apart from the owners being shitty, the place was almost exclusively visited by Families, as we had a big Sandbox in the middle of the terrace, and the entire thing was marketed towards families with kids. You can bet your ass the parents took this as ""Guess I don't have to watch my crotchgoblins then!"". Nearly every time I tried to bring an order to a table some kid walked right into me and almost made me trip, but eh who cares.  Most customers were super rude, just ordered so they can sit and let their kids play. Tips were shit, and cleaning up at the end of the shift was always a nightmare. Dried up icecream and trash sticking to it coated basically the whole place since none of the parents had the decency to care for what they\`re kids did. Sometimes kids just took buckets of sand inside the Cafè and played there, which made the floor super slippery and I've slipped several times when I was the server, luckily never with a full tray.   
A few months after I stared working there, in the middle of summer, it was super full and the entire staff was beyond their breaking point, because of the shitty management there was no possible way to get out orders in time. One time a kid took a dump in the sandbox, which riddled the entire terrace with a stench that can hardly be put into words. The parents did nothing, even though they saw it. The kid then proceeded to go on the little slide we had, and covered it in shit too. Parent's did nothing. None of the staff members had time to deal with the situation, so I asked the boss to talk to the parents. He reluctantly did, and I heard them argue that kids do things like these and that its no big deal. He then came to me and told me that he would be taking over for me and that I should clean up the sandbox. Apart from the fact that this was bullshit, him taking over would just send of a cascade of pure chaos, since he didn't have a clue which tables already ordered, which ones payed, etc. At that point I was already so broken inside from customers yelling at me all day that I just took the shovel and the bucket and did it.  It was absolutely foul. No idea what that kid ate, but even I in my entire 22 years of like have not produced something so vile. When I was done I walked past the parents table, and instead of thanking me they informed me that they would like to get another water and a scoop of icecream for the little shitter, I told them boss is taking orders now, which they seemed to ignore.   
After I threw away the bucket and everything that touched it and cleaned my hands for what felt like an hour, I see boss having nothing under control, tickets are all over the place, my coworkers are arguing with him and finished orders are melting away on the bar because boss doesn't have a clue where to bring them since I was the one who took these orders. So after messing up my entire system. messing up the existing tickets by bringing them to wrong tables, and basically dooming the entire workday, he just gave me back the wallet and the orderman and tells me that I could take over now. I thought about just handing him my apron and quitting, but looking at the faces of my coworkers who looked like they had given up on life, I decided to try to help them.   
The entire shift after that was an absolute mess, customers refused to pay because of delays, orders were forgotten, yada yada. When most of the customers were gone me and my coworkers took a break, sat outside in the sun and had a beer before cleaning up, none of us talked.  
I would have quit, but I did really like my coworkers and didn't want to leave them hanging, so I kept working there til my contract ended.

When I started I was specifically told, we will bring the cake to the table but we don’t put candles in it or light them, and the guest serves themselves, we don’t cut outside cakes, the guest does that.

i thought that was crazy...until I had my third cake while working there that they said they wanted 21 candles, which when I took the cake from the cooler I placed the 21 candies, brought the cake out lit it for Happy Birthday,....and was bitched at that the candle placement  “‘ruined the design.”

so nope, never again, as per policy we don’t cut, package leftovers to go, apply candles, or light candles on outside cake and we don’t sing. It’s not our product.

Tonight was doing a 12 top they had a cake, I brought out a large oval tray with cake, serving plates for # of guests,  silverware, knife and serving utensils.

my partner was not happy I was 100% against cutting and serving...he‘s new.

I asked him...”are we getting tipped off that fucking cake? Is it going on our sales? Do we charge a cake-age fee? Will we see a dime over the autograt in it if we do that?”

Took everything out, told the guests ‘We leave outside cakes up to the guest so they can control both it and the piece size, if you need boxes to take slices home let me know.”

They were ok with that answer.

about 10 minutes later my partner comes up to tell me “The cake is a disaster”

”What?”

”I guess the middle layer was hard (it was carmel supposedly, they had told us to fridge the cake) and when they cut it they couldn’t get through and the layers separated and moved around and one layer slipped off to the side.”

Well it&amp;#39;s like 15 minutes to closing so I go check with my manager and he tells me to sit them outside and they would be the last table. So I sit them and start cleaning my menus for the night and like 20 minutes later I see the same guy talking to his server and he looked upset so I walk over to help out. The man points at me as soon as I start walking over and says &amp;quot;him that&amp;#39;s the guy I ordered it from&amp;quot; me and server give each other a look of pure confusion. The server then says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry but he is the host you can&amp;#39;t order with him&amp;quot;. The guys then looks at me &amp;quot;I told you I wanted the triple dipper&amp;quot;. I then say &amp;quot;Yes you did sir, but I had told you when I sat you that you would have to order with your server.&amp;quot; The guy then storms away and I went back to cleaning. Afterwards when they left I was finishing cleaning and the server then walked over and we started joking about about it saying that I didn&amp;#39;t remember training for it and things like that. I never really figured out what happened afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Sorry but i always see these posts but want to share my story. I’ve been working as a host at an Asian restaurant for over a year now (in January) and my job said to just learn the menu and they’d make me a server. The days I work aren’t even that busy but I sometimes will need to bus a table or two if it gets busy.

So i asked questions about being promoted a couple of weeks ago my manager said they’d promote me when they hire some new hosts (no one is applying here to my knowledge). One person was promoted before me after working only for a couple of weeks and I’m convinced it’s because they are from the same racial and ethnic background as the owners.

Another person was hired then told not to come back after their first day on the floor alone due to a rush (an 8 top, 6 top and some smaller tables came in all within a span of 30 minutes, they were the only server on the floor) and they didn’t perform adequately. Bartender and management were talking shit the entire time.

So third strike is that this girl who has barely any server experience comes in gets a serving job on the spot, she looks familiar because she was fired from my previous job (love triangle in the job gone wrong). Turns out she is the same race/ethnic background as well as the owners. She starts training and is on the schedule, so I confront my manager and ask what the deal was because I thought we were looking for hosts and I could be promoted to server (I’m reliable, friendly, know the menu inside and out). He just reiterated that they need me as a host and can’t promote me until they find someone for me to train.

Not only do I feel like I’ve been discriminated against for my race (or not being a certain race) but I feel so stupid for sticking around so long, picking up shifts when needed, coming in on days off (including during my vacation when servers NCNS), and being a team player. My sister is a lawyer and says it sounds like a Title VII claim waiting to happen. 

Thankfully I got a job serving at a corporate chain. My first night on the floor the other night went great and now I feel like I can get this experience I want and move on from hosting. It’s not glamorous but I’m going to learn the ropes and move on when it is time. I’m finishing my two weeks and the management is giving me the cold shoulder but I don’t care because at least I gave notice!

I know it’s a tale as old as time but just remember it’s not you, it’s them. They could train you if they wanted to.

Nope they are definitely margaritas. 

2) he reorders the drink, bartender runs it out and he’s convinced it isn’t the same drink. Bitches about it but drinks it. Whatever.

A little background! In the restaurant I used to work at, whenever someone had a birthday we would play happy birthday loudly and bring out a slice of cake with a candle on the house. I loved it! It would get specially old people and kids so happy! We would know through reservations or simply by having someone go over to a waiter and letting them know.

It was a busy friday afternoon and I had this couple at a table. The typical table where their answer to „hey! How are you guys tonight?“ is „a diet coke and a beer“. They had had no reservation and no presents or balloons with them.

We always gathered many birthdays in different sections so we wouldn‘t constantly be playing happy birthday. The couple was finished eating and were drinking as we brought out a round of birthdays. Once the music was off the woman waved me over, looking seriously pissed.

Me: Hey! How can I help you guys?
Her: Well, it‘s my husbands birthday today, where is his cake?
Me: oh, I wasn‘t aware of it ma‘am, sorry! I‘ll gladly bring him one in a few minutes!
Her: no! The surprise is now ruined! We don‘t want your leftovers! The service is terrible! Ruining his birthday like this!
Me: I‘m so sorry, did you tell one of my colleagues that it was his birthday? They must have forgotten it, I really am so sorry for that.
Her: no, we didn‘t! But that‘s something you should know as a waitress!

I stood still for a few seconds, unsure about what to say, the husband seemed to be really embarrassed, sinking in his chair without saying anything. 

Me: oh... ermm... I‘m sorry about that, we really have no way of knowing! Next time simply let one of us know and we‘ll be more than happy to do it! As I said, I can still bring you guys a slice!
Her, rolling her eyes: as I said, we don‘t want it anymore, we‘re never coming back here! Just get us the bill!

I went to get their bill and the woman was furious when she noticed „I didn‘t even take the drinks off“ like... why would I take something off because you didn‘t get the free thing you didn‘t order?

A little background! In the restaurant I used to work at, whenever someone had a birthday we would play happy birthday loudly and bring out a slice of cake with a candle on the house. I loved it! It would get specially old people and kids so happy! We would know through reservations or simply by having someone go over to a waiter and letting them know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a busy friday afternoon and I had this couple at a table. The typical table where their answer to „hey! How are you guys tonight?“ is „a diet coke and a beer“. They had had no reservation and no presents or balloons with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always gathered many birthdays in different sections so we wouldn‘t constantly be playing happy birthday. The couple was finished eating and were drinking as we brought out a round of birthdays. Once the music was off the woman waved me over, looking seriously pissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Hey! How can I help you guys?
Her: Well, it‘s my husbands birthday today, where is his cake?
Me: oh, I wasn‘t aware of it ma‘am, sorry! I‘ll gladly bring him one in a few minutes!
Her: no! The surprise is now ruined! We don‘t want your leftovers! The service is terrible! Ruining his birthday like this!
Me: I‘m so sorry, did you tell one of my colleagues that it was his birthday? They must have forgotten it, I really am so sorry for that.
Her: no, we didn‘t! But that‘s something you should know as a waitress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood still for a few seconds, unsure about what to say, the husband seemed to be really embarrassed, sinking in his chair without saying anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: oh... ermm... I‘m sorry about that, we really have no way of knowing! Next time simply let one of us know and we‘ll be more than happy to do it! As I said, I can still bring you guys a slice!
Her, rolling her eyes: as I said, we don‘t want it anymore, we‘re never coming back here! Just get us the bill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to get their bill and the woman was furious when she noticed „I didn‘t even take the drinks off“ like... why would I take something off because you didn‘t get the free thing you didn‘t order? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly no tip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bad, next time I‘ll read everyone‘s mind!&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I've been in food and beverage for most of my life. On rare occasions I've seen maybe 1 or 2 servers get into an altercation with customers ever. Yesterday I had a table come in and everything started out fine. They came in during the lunch rush I got them taken care of in a timely fashion and everything seemed fine. I cleared all their plates except for 2 that they were picking off of. They ended up sitting there with the plates for a long time. I asked a few times if they were still eating and everytime they said yes. So I left them alone trying not to bother them. I got busy taking care of other tables and started cashing out tables tables that got there before them. I was walking back to the kitchen when a guy from this table comes up to me with his credit card in hand. He looks at me and says 

""hey buddy you ever done this before?"" So I asked him
 
""have I ever done what before?"" 

""You ever waited tables before?"" Which really rubbed me the wrong way. So I asked him if he was ready to cash out and took his card. Even though we were slammed I got him cashed out quick and told them to have a nice day. 

I went to go talk to another table and get their order and while I'm standing there at this other table this asshole come up to me and starts staring me down. He was close enough to where I could almost feel him breathing down my neck. I looked at my table and apologized and told them to give me a second. I turned to the asshole and asked him if there was something else I could help him with. He shoved his card in my face and said ""yeah little pro tip for you, try not to hand people their card back with fucking grease on it!"" 

Apparently I had a little grease on my finger which I didn't even notice while I was running around. This guy was in my face and being a grade A dick. I was busy and didn't have time to deal with his nonsense so I said ""sir please leave"" and walked away because I had orders to put in and other things to do  As you can imagine that didn't go over very well. He started yelling 

""where's your manager? I need to speak to a manager!"" Both of which were behind the bar so I said either of them can help you and started putting in my orders on the computer. While I'm standing there he keeps asking me where the manager is (who are still in the same place about 5ft away.) I point them out again. While he's waiting he's standing there tying to get a rise out of me and starts talking shit. He asks me 

""So do you like working here?""

""Yes"" 

""Well too bad because you're out buddy!"" 

So after that I just ignored him until a manager came over. He tells them what happened and finally he leaves. I go back to the table I was talking to when he confronted me and apologized for the scene. They told me they were ready to step in because they though he was about to start swinging.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This is not a super wild story but it's the first time it's happened to me, and I thought it was a pretty weird/comical situation

A Karen and her family sit down and I bring them water, saying their waitress is going to be over with them soon (they are not in my section) 

They ask me to taste one of our wines, which I didn't mind so much because I wasn't that busy and I didn't want to be rude to them. They ask me details about it and thankfully I know that one well, because I've had it a few times and once a sommelier tasted and described it in front of me. 

I bring it over, Karen tastes it and approves of it, ask me for a bottle.

When I bring it over, Karen motions me to look at her phone, on which she has the liquor store website opened (in Quebec they have the same prices in all of them) and proceeds to show me how much cheaper it is to buy it there. Also, she says it's ""funny"" how they don't mention the caramelized notes that I talked about, and instead say the wine tastes of red fruits and spices. 

I say it's a pretty safe bet considering you could say that just about any red wines, and ask them what THEY taste. Not in a mean way, more a friendly- conversational - make them show their wine knowledge - way. 

She kind of laughs it off and proceeds to complain some more about the ridiculous price difference between the liquor store and the restaurant.

I mean, lady, have you ever ordered wine at a restaurant? What do you want me to say? Oh! I didnt realise they didn't sell it for 40$ at the liquor store. Let me go fix that, it is now 13$ and the restaurant is losing money:) 

Meanwhile I'm standing there like do I open the bottle or not? 

Then the husband says something to brighten up the mood along the lines of ""it's the price you pay to discover a new kind of wine and that's priceless"" which is stupid for so many reasons but whatever. They buy the bottle. 

Later on she complained that she actually hated the wine and would never get it again. She tells my bartender she should've gotten the one she saw her pouring earlier.  Jokes on you Karen, that one is 50$

,TalesFromYourServer,"Welp, I was finally forced to find a new job due to how incredibly slow my restaurant continues to be even as we prepare for the busy season. Let me relieve all my grievances of this joint. 

It's a local chain, and from what I'm told, the higher-ups in the company care nothing for anyone, and that was clear from the lowest employee up. Our district manager, who was based out of our location and managed some days, quit because he wasn't respected enough, which says something.

Let's talk about him for a minute. This guy introduces himself to me by telling him 'now, keep in mind when you work with me, anything that happens is just business, don't take it personally.' Well, what that means is that his management technique is literal bullying. A small step out of line and he begins yelling at you, he made at least one employee cry every shift he manged, and when he was asked to come and speak with a liquor rep or a customer, he'd say 'tell them I'm not in today.' I literally jumped for joy when he quit. 

Brings me to the AGM, who was kinda mentored by the district manager. He started out cool enough, but he very quickly began using the DM's language and I knew we had a problem. This guy had no idea how to speak with customers and would literally yell or curse at them when they weren't where he wanted them or they complained. Nobody likes this guy and we all agree he doesn't know what he's doing. But according to the GM, he's actually good compared to other people in the larger company so he kept his job. 

I was a host, so we had to do a lot of togo orders. Well, I was required to enter the customer's credit card info over the phone so it was paid for beforehand. I don't understand why anyone in their right mind would give out their full credit card info over the phone. Most bartenders, who you had to transfer to if a customer refused to give out their card info, would be understanding, but there was one or two who would get so mad because 'that's not company policy.' Not to mention if one of the more rigid managers heard of it you'd get chewed out, all for making the experience easier for the customer.

 When you come to work, you're there to do the job, right? There were so many servers who were younger than me and still thought the world revolved around their own ass. We'd get attitude consistently when trying to get servers or bussers to do their damn job.

And finally, worst of all, our kitchen was insanely inconsistent. As I entered my togos, I left distinct and exacting instructions of what the customer wanted. These were noticed about 25% of the time when I entered it on the POS, pretty consistently when I went back and told them, but I shouldn't have to do that, right? I literally got my first yelp review calling me out by name because of the kitchen's inability to properly spread sauce on wings.

So... why did I stay so long? Well, the people there were pretty great, other than the attitudey ones.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Okay... weird things going on at the moment. So I don’t know if this has anything to do with the lie he told me, but I’m just going to clarify in case it does: a couple days ago I reported this same boss for an incident I heard about from another host about how he let a customer stay after they threatened to shoot up the place (even though you’re supposed to take every threat seriously and kick them out). And yes, the server who got threatened came up to him crying and told him what happened and he told her to let them stay. I called corporate and filed a report against him. Anyways, now that that’s out of the way, something very strange occurred today. A couple days before today I got my automated text for my schedule and it sent out two different texts, one said I was working today and the other said I wasn’t. So, to be sure before I get all dressed up and come in only to be told I’m not working today, I called up the restaurant and asked my manager (as I said before, he’s the same guy who I reported) whether I was working today or not and what was going on with the automated texts. He told me I’m not working today and that I wasn’t going to work today because another manager fired one of the hosts (not going to tell her name for privacy concerns). This didn’t make any sense to me because why would I NOT work cause someone was fired? I don’t know, it would make more sense if he said she was GOING to be fired but instead wasn’t, but he straight up said that she WAS fired. So anyways, I texted the girl a couple hours later and asked why she was fired and she said “what are you talking about? I’m at work right now.” Just... what?

,TalesFromYourServer,"So, as the title suggests, yesterday my towns university had a home game, along with a large scale basketball tourney for kids, and some speech convention for high schoolers. Needless to say, we were packed.

We had 3 call ahead large groups (a 20, 11, and another 20) all at noon. We open at 11, so we set aside space for them assuming anyone who got there around 11 wouldn't be gone by 12. Y'know, normal restaurant stuff. 

So, around or before 10:40ish some guy and his wife walk in and ask if were open. I was hosting that day and opened. I just accepted it and said something along the lines of ""not yet but i can get you seated anyway"" because I had a server there already and she was bored. So I took them to the servers section, and they rejected the spot, and requested something in the middle of where we were saving. I told them I would double check what all this server had so I could get them as close to what they wanted, and they just walked their happy ass over and sat down RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of our reserved section

Now, our manager is also pissed at this, but is all about being nice to customers so she didn't make them move. I then walk back over and bring their menus and stuff to the new table, and the get very upset as to why our TVs aren't on. ""They'll come on around 11, when we open"" 

To which they say things like ""oh **around** 11? Will they come on or what?"" And a bunch of whiney patronizing stuff.

Now we are not a large restaurant, and obviously can't get these people all in at once (not to mention, who just *shows up* with 25 people without calling?)

So the other host and I, along with the GM, spent our day frantically trying to menouver these groups to get tables despite the fact we couldn't pull things together because the TV couple was literally just hanging out in the middle of our movable tables, with no signs of leaving any time soon.

To top it all off, almost every group was rude about the wait, and rather than stay towards the waiting area they crowded the entire restaurant and got in everyone's way. Their kids were just running around treating the place like a damn playground as well.

They wondered if the servers got any part of the cover and genuinely I did not know. Still don't.

&lt;p&gt;They wondered if the servers got any part of the cover and genuinely I did not know. Still don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night these guys left me a 40% tip on a $112 bill. I could have cried. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope they understand how grateful I was for thier conversation, their personalities, and thier genuine concern for all of us working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to share such a positive experience with you guys. So often we are looked down on and seen as unworthy of praise, consideration, and basic human kindness because we are in the service industry. But we all deserve the kind of people I was blessed with tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck out there everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

I have been in the industry for 17 years and can’t believe I didn’t know this. Just quit a job and found out the mandatory tip pool was massively illegal:
If you are required to tip out the owner, manager, supervisor, or any kitchen staff, this is illegal and you are entitled to back pay and they can be fined. I knew it was shitty behavior but did not know it was illegal!
If this happened to you at a previous job you have up to 2 years to take action, report them to the department of labor, or sue.
You can also find even more info by state, and I recommend familiarizing yourself with these rules and telling EVERYONE you know in the industry. 

Personally I am giving my ex restaurant the benefit of the doubt (for a month), you never know maybe they had no idea this was illegal either. I forwarded them this info and another article by a lawyer in our state, and will check back in a month with a friend that still works there.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This happened last night, it was my first table of the night. A man walks in with his two kids, he looks at the sign we have on the counter, then walks forward. I ask him if he would like a booth or table, he says booth. I seat them, and then ask what they would like  to drink. (We don't really do introductions where I work.) 

He says the special. I knew what he was talking about, but that was for food, and I was trying to take their drink orders. So, I ask again what would they like to drink, he says I want the pickup special, and I say yes, you can do that, but it is a large 2 topping for dine in. Not a large 3 topping. But before I can finish saying that, he loudly says we're going somewhere else, I can't stand your attitude. You cant answer a simple question. 

Once he says that, I'm just incredibly confused. And just stand there as he is getting up. Then he asks where our manager is. I say he is upfront. He gets up, walks up to the counter, and proceeds to spew some lying bullshit to my manager about how I was rude and had an attitude. He leaves, good fucking riddance. Then my manager comes over, I explain what happened, he doesn't give a shit, and then says you need to watch what you say because you can come off as rude. 

This entire situation is hilarious. I have never had a customer complain about me being rude before ever, in fact, I am the server who usually gets the most compliments from customers. Also, I'm just thinking that it's hilarious that my manager says I'm rude, when he is literally one of the worst managers ever to his employees.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Last night we were slammed all evening, but everyone was performing well. Wait times were on point, the kitchen didn’t get backed up once, the dishwasher, despite being alone for the night, was a total rockstar. You get the idea. 

ANYHOW, let me introduce some folks I’ll henceforth refer to as Horrible Cunt Table, or HCT. 
The first I heard of Horrible Cunt Table was through murmurs from the bussers. According to kitchen-wide lore, HCT had asked for a manager as soon as they were seated, and our MOD had been stuck getting harangued by them for the past ten minutes. 

Thirty more minutes or so pass—I’m consumed by my own section, so I don’t give Horrible Cunt Table another thought. On a trip back to the kitchen from my tables, I happen to pass by HCT and it looks like they’re in need of boxes. Silverware is down, entrees are looking finished, not a single person is chewing.

Wait times were on point, the kitchen didn’t get backed up once, the dishwasher, despite being alone for the night, was a total rockstar. You get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYHOW, let me introduce some folks I’ll henceforth refer to as Horrible Cunt Table, or HCT. 
The first I heard of Horrible Cunt Table was through murmurs from the bussers. According to kitchen-wide lore, HCT had asked for a manager as soon as they were seated, and our MOD had been stuck getting harangued by them for the past ten minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty more minutes or so pass—I’m consumed by my own section, so I don’t give Horrible Cunt Table another thought. On a trip back to the kitchen from my tables, I happen to pass by HCT and it looks like they’re in need of boxes. Silverware is down, entrees are looking finished, not a single person is chewing. I, being a team player, (and out of morbid curiosity for an interaction with these people) approach and ask, sweetly, “May I get you folks some boxes?” HC#1 snaps her head in my direction, owl-like, unnaturally, and says in her best Spongebob Chicken Mocking Voice “NoO, We’Re StiLl EaTinG.

,TalesFromYourServer,"At my restaurant, all servers have to tipshare a percentage of their sales with the bartender. Apparently it is like a thank you for the bartender making drinks for other tables and because the bartender might be too busy making drinks to take enough tables for themself. I am very much against this since the majority of the time, the bartenders get all the people who want to sit in the bar plus their tables, so they almost always end up having more in sales than pretty much anyone else at the restaurant.

Anyway, so I made x number of sales yesterday with very little tips from the shift. After doing the math, my tipshare to the bartender came to exactly the number of tips I made for the whole shift (e.g. if I made 300 in sales, and 15 in tips. if tipshare was 5% of sales, I would have to give 15 to bartender.) I let her know I wouldn't be tipsharing since the tipshare amount is all I made in sales. She immediately called our manager and fussed about it. I ended up having to hand it over so I went home having put in a 4 hour shift with exactly $0 in income.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I usually just leave work at work, assholes be damned, but this lady got under my skin real good this time. 

We have a burger special on Fridays that Umbridge occasionally comes in for, but I just transferred back to this location after being gone a few years, so that makes this our first encounter in some time. Pretty sure she doesn’t recognize me, which is ironic. Back in the day, I was the designated server to take care of her and her group because they would verbally abuse every other server. I did a lot of anger management therapy at one point, so I’ve become pretty good at shutting my mouth when I want to explode. It’s really the only reason I can deal with her at all, and why I would always get stuck with her. She would *request* me, because she said the other servers were *too rude*. You’ll see that fucking irony in a second.

Anyway, they get sat, and I’m dreading the moment that she recognizes me and asks for me as their server. It never comes, she doesn’t seem to remember me at all, and I’m fucking elated. We were slammed and had a new server working who was halfway to weeded. She’s the one who ended up taking them. Call me selfish, I don’t care. I was not about to go out of my way to interact with her, newbie be damned. I had already picked up three of the new girl’s tables in addition to my own to help her out. She was on her own for this one.

In the past, she’s always been the epitome of a problem customer. Always trying to scheme for free food (“You charged me for an order of onion rings but I just wanted a side! You do too have a smaller portion, I’ve gotten it before!” No bitch, we don’t and you haven’t. It’s one size at one price, deal. “Yes, I ate the burger, but it was dry and your kitchen cooked it too long. I shouldn’t have to pay for a burger I didn’t like!” I asked you how your food came out and you said good. Now that you’re done eating, it was bad.) 

You get the type. Super rude, out of her mind. She also likes to bring her token black friend in with her from time to time and imply that random complaints she has are based in race (like the one time her friend’s plate had *numerically* less onion rings than hers, which she insisted was intentionally done because her friend was black. Demanded additional free onion rings. Her friend had less rings numerically because one of them was huge, whereas she had more rings that were smaller sized.) Her friend hasn’t ever implied such a thing herself and is generally nice to us, but she also doesn’t make any effort to stop her. They all living in a nearby retirement community together, so maybe she just doesn’t want to deal with the social circle drama that would result. Who the fuck knows. 

Anyway.

So it’s the middle of a rush, and I hear from newbie that Umbridge is losing her mind about something. Shocker. I’m too busy to ask for details, the manager is handling it, and I want nothing to do with them. I keep doing my thing, grateful she isn’t my problem. We’re pretty busy, and food is taking longer than usual, so I’ve got my own issues to deal with.

That is, until I see her walking into the BOH server line. For context, there was an incident years ago where she was so angry that her food was taking too long that she walked *into our server line* and started moving around other people’s food in the window looking for her burger. She was convinced that her food was ready and we were refusing to run it to her. I was the only one working yesterday that knew about her doing this in the past, and the only one who had noticed her at all so far. I saw her coming towards us, and told her as calmly as I could, “Hey, we can’t have customers back here.” 

Bitch lost her damn mind. Started screaming about how I was a little smartass and how she was going to have me fired. My manager was standing here for all of this, and he took over while I bit my tongue and went back to traying up food. I overhear her telling him how I’ve been so nasty this entire time (I’m not even her server? I have not spoken to her prior?) and how the only reason their food is taking so long is because we’re all racist against her black friend dining with her (dear god, grant me patience.) 

She gets a shitload of free onion rings while they’re waiting (you’d think she would be in heaven), and she spends that time harassing me while I’m talking to tables I have her in vicinity. I would ask customers how their food was, and she would loudly talk at me and them about how this was my last shift and how being a smartass is going to ruin my life. My tables all snickered at her about it, so it was a lot more embarrassing for her than me. Personally, I was just trying to remember my breathing exercises. Still, I persisted. Didn’t say a fucking word back. Thank god for therapy.

Food finally comes out, and they make a big, loud show about boxing it into to-go boxes, talking to nearby tables about how the service has gone to “hell in a race car” in recent years. Whatever the fuck that means. Our manager drops their check with a discount, and Umbridge marches her ass up to our host on duty. She hands her the bill for six people’s food and informs her they won’t be paying for any of it. Our manager has been yelled at by her multiple times now, been followed around the restaurant by her several times as he tried to check on the other thirty tables we have. He’s watched her harass his entire staff and other customers in the restaurant. To say he’s over her shit would be an understatement. He tells her that if she doesn’t plan to pay the tab, he would be calling the police. 

She ends up paying it, but hangs around a while after to loudly complain about her experience. The entire restaurant is quietly laughing at her at this point, and she eventually exits after telling us all we will be hearing from her lawyer about a racial discrimination suit. For what it’s worth, she’s white. Everyone working this morning was white. 

I’m hoping this means she never comes back, but she always fucking does. I’m sure I’ll be hearing from corporate about how I should have handled my one, calm sentence spoken to her better after they give her a bunch of gift cards to ‘make it up’ to her. 

Bright side, I don’t see her requesting me any time soon. Downside, I stay through alone a lot of Friday afternoons, so a reunion may be inevitable. I’m planning to print a copy of the serenity prayer to keep in my server book.

Sorry it was so long. I just really needed to cut that poison out of my brain.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I had the rudest lady at one of my tables last night guys, and I'm still kinda mad about it.

So she gets sat with two roll ups,  so I know she's waiting for someone. I go over to see if she wants something to drink while she waits.

Me: Hi, how are you?

Lady: *silence, doesnt even acknowledge me*

Me: Ok, my names Kait...

Lady: *pulls phone out of purse, dials, and holds it up to her ear*

I walk away, kinda like wtf. Was this lady raised by cavemen? Idk. I go up to my manager and told him what happened and he goes ""Yeah, I wouldn't go back there until she waved me down, personally."" I figured I'd wait until her second person got there so I could get them in and out and over with.

15 minutes later her (what I assume to be) husband shows up, so I go over to get them drinks. He orders a water, and she says she doesnt want anything to drink. Ok. I go ""Ok, I'll be right back with that water,"" and as I step away she goes ""Wait! I want a hot water!"" Ok, fine. I go get their waters.

Drop off the waters, and the man says he has some questions about the menu. No problemo, that's what I'm here for, I dont mind answering questions. I feel like I know a hell of a lot about steak for someone who doesn't eat it.
Man: What's the best steak? (I dont like just saying a steak because everyone's different with what kind of steak they like)

Me: Depends really. Do you like a more lean steak or fatty steak?

Man: Lean.

Me: Ok, so you're going to want a filet, strip, or...

Lady: What's better, the rice or the fries?

Me: ... sirloin. I like the rice better.

Man: Thoes are the leaner steaks?

Me: Yup, and each...

Lady: My friend said you should get the ribeye. The ribeye is good.

Man: She says the ribeye is fatty. I don't want fatty.

Lady: You can cut the fat off

Me: The fat is kinda running through the ribeye, so that's be hard to do.

Man: I'll get the filet. That ones thicker than the strip, right?

Me: Yup, that ones going to be the most tender too.

Lady: You should get the ribeye. My friend said the ribeye is good.

Man: Maybe next time.

Me: ok, and what sides do you want with that sir?

Man: Fries and veggies.

Lady: Why would you get the fries! She said the rice was better!

Me: The fries are...

Lady: You should get the rice!

Man: Maybe next time. Are your flavored lemonades refillable? 

Me: Yes sir.

Man: Can I have a blue lemonade?

Me: Sure thing


So now I try to take this lady's order. She's been sitting at the table for 25 minutes now, so you would think that she knew what she wanted right? Nope. Not at all. She hemmed and hawwed, all the while I had one table that had just been sat and my other table was waiting for their check.
She kept saying she wanted one thing, then no she didnt want that. She said she wasnt that hungry, so she didnt want a lot of food. Finally, she settled on a kicker of ribs with the bbq sauce on the side because she doesnt like thick bbq sauce, whatever. I run to my other tables real quick, then put in their food and go grab the man a blue lemonade. 

Their food comes out, I kind of ignore them because I dont want to interactwith her more than I have to. I see she eats like 2 of the 4 ribs and then disappears for 20 minutes. I go up to the man and ask if they want any boxes, because his food is all gone and all they have are her ribs. He says that he doesnt know, and to wait until she gets back because he doesnt know if she's done.

She gets back and picks at her ribs some more. Keep in mind she's been here and hour and a half already. I go up and see if they need anything and she fucking says she wants to order food. Fuck her. She wants catfish. Fine. Husband asks her if she wants it togo? She says ""No, I want to eat it here."" Whatever. The man's lemonade is empty.

Me: Sir, do you want another blue lemonade?

Man: Sure, thanks.

Lady: It tasted weird. What other flavors do you have?

Me: Strawberry and raspberry.

Lady: Get the strawberry, the blue one tastes bad.

Man: It tasted fine.

Me: *ignoring the lady and straight up looking at him* Do YOU want the blue lemonade?

Man: No, just get the strawberry I guess.

Drop the lemonade off, their food gets dropped off. She sits there and picks at it FOR AN HOUR. Just takes off a pinch and eats it while looking at her phone. Her poor husband has taken to sitting with his back against the wall and legs up in the booth and is on his phone. The man is obviously bored out of his mind. I want to go over there and tell him to blink twice if he is in trouble and needs help. I'm telling my manager what's happening as its happening and hes laughing at my expense. I've never wanted to smack someone so badly in my life. I tell my manager I might hit this lady and go to jail. He asks if I'll need bail money. Probably.
 
They finally ask for a box and the check. Drop both off, pick up the check. Cash. Left me 10% and they sat for another 15 minutes while she played on her phone. Finally left after 3 hours of hell.

&lt;p&gt;So she gets sat with two roll ups,  so I know she&amp;#39;s waiting for someone. I go over to see if she wants something to drink while she waits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Hi, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: &lt;em&gt;silence, doesnt even acknowledge me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok, my names Kait...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: &lt;em&gt;pulls phone out of purse, dials, and holds it up to her ear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk away, kinda like wtf. Was this lady raised by cavemen? Idk. I go up to my manager and told him what happened and he goes &amp;quot;Yeah, I wouldn&amp;#39;t go back there until she waved me down, personally.&amp;quot; I figured I&amp;#39;d wait until her second person got there so I could get them in and out and over with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 minutes later her (what I assume to be) husband shows up, so I go over to get them drinks. He orders a water, and she says she doesnt want anything to drink. Ok. I go &amp;quot;Ok, I&amp;#39;ll be right back with that water,&amp;quot; and as I step away she goes &amp;quot;Wait! I want a hot water!&amp;quot; Ok, fine. I go get their waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop off the waters, and the man says he has some questions about the menu. No problemo, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m here for, I dont mind answering questions. I feel like I know a hell of a lot about steak for someone who doesn&amp;#39;t eat it.
Man: What&amp;#39;s the best steak? (I dont like just saying a steak because everyone&amp;#39;s different with what kind of steak they like)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Depends really. Do you like a more lean steak or fatty steak?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: Lean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok, so you&amp;#39;re going to want a filet, strip, or...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: What&amp;#39;s better, the rice or the fries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: ... sirloin. I like the rice better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: Thoes are the leaner steaks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yup, and each...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: My friend said you should get the ribeye. The ribeye is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: She says the ribeye is fatty. I don&amp;#39;t want fatty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: You can cut the fat off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: The fat is kinda running through the ribeye, so that&amp;#39;s be hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: I&amp;#39;ll get the filet. That ones thicker than the strip, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yup, that ones going to be the most tender too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: You should get the ribeye. My friend said the ribeye is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: ok, and what sides do you want with that sir?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: Fries and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: Why would you get the fries! She said the rice was better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: The fries are...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: You should get the rice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: Maybe next time. Are your flavored lemonades refillable? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes sir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: Can I have a blue lemonade?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Sure thing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I try to take this lady&amp;#39;s order. She&amp;#39;s been sitting at the table for 25 minutes now, so you would think that she knew what she wanted right? Nope. Not at all. She hemmed and hawwed, all the while I had one table that had just been sat and my other table was waiting for their check.
She kept saying she wanted one thing, then no she didnt want that. She said she wasnt that hungry, so she didnt want a lot of food. Finally, she settled on a kicker of ribs with the bbq sauce on the side because she doesnt like thick bbq sauce, whatever. I run to my other tables real quick, then put in their food and go grab the man a blue lemonade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their food comes out, I kind of ignore them because I dont want to interactwith her more than I have to. I see she eats like 2 of the 4 ribs and then disappears for 20 minutes. I go up to the man and ask if they want any boxes, because his food is all gone and all they have are her ribs. He says that he doesnt know, and to wait until she gets back because he doesnt know if she&amp;#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gets back and picks at her ribs some more. Keep in mind she&amp;#39;s been here and hour and a half already. I go up and see if they need anything and she fucking says she wants to order food. Fuck her. She wants catfish. Fine. Husband asks her if she wants it togo? She says &amp;quot;No, I want to eat it here.&amp;quot; Whatever. The man&amp;#39;s lemonade is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Sir, do you want another blue lemonade?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: Sure, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: It tasted weird. What other flavors do you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Strawberry and raspberry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: Get the strawberry, the blue one tastes bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: It tasted fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;ignoring the lady and straight up looking at him&lt;/em&gt; Do YOU want the blue lemonade?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man: No, just get the strawberry I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop the lemonade off, their food gets dropped off. She sits there and picks at it FOR AN HOUR. Just takes off a pinch and eats it while looking at her phone. Her poor husband has taken to sitting with his back against the wall and legs up in the booth and is on his phone. The man is obviously bored out of his mind. I want to go over there and tell him to blink twice if he is in trouble and needs help. I&amp;#39;m telling my manager what&amp;#39;s happening as its happening and hes laughing at my expense. I&amp;#39;ve never wanted to smack someone so badly in my life. I tell my manager I might hit this lady and go to jail. He asks if I&amp;#39;ll need bail money. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They finally ask for a box and the check. Drop both off, pick up the check. Cash. Left me 10% and they sat for another 15 minutes while she played on her phone. Finally left after 3 hours of hell. I hope I never see that lady again.&lt;/p&gt;

Little back story, our restaurant is extremely busy on Saturday and Sunday. To the point where we don't take reservations on either day.  

EVER. 

We have a 18 top come in. State they had a reservation. Automatically, we absolutely know that's a lie. 

We found out that our other store in my town would accommodate them, but they refused they wanted it at our store. 

Cool, they would have to wait for a table. 

Waited close to 45 min for this table, party went from an 18 to a 13. 

Get them all situated, find out it's a mother fucking baby shower.

Everyone was good, except ONE person. 

I went to see if anyone wanted drinks and this bitch literally clapped at me.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So this is two stories of how yesterday can go and fuck itself long dick style.

I'm the Assistant Manager for a high end restaurant in a tourist area. Winters suck, summers are busy and make you want to kill yourself. Summer it's a 70 head ship, winter, it's a skeleton crew. So I'm also the host/takeout guy/phone answerer/keg changer/magician.

Very nice person calls looking to reserve. 
I'm halfway through writing down their information while on the phone when entitled bastard and wife come in.
He marches right past the host stand with the menus, ignores me as his wife enters the restroom and loudly says ""I'll go find us a Table.""
I apologise to the person on the phone, place them on hold and go to catch this guy.
""Excuse me sir, one moment please, I need to check you in and seat you.""
""Yeah, well, you ignored us.""
""Sir, I'm on the phone taking a reservation.""
""So a phone call takes priority over a walk in?""
The guy is screaming at me at this point. Both servers hear it. 
""Well sir, we typically get to guests in the order of contact. If this person had called as you entered, I would have asked them to hold. But as I was halfway through confirming the reservation, finishing that would have taken less time and still had you seated.""
""So. You're going to ignore someone in front of you for the phone.""
At this point, I know, my boss would absolutely back me on kicking him out. I could probably get away with telling him to fuck himself sideways.
But. It's winter. My servers need tips. So I swallow it down. I tell him I'll get him a table and seat the smug fuck who proceeds to tip 10%.
Both servers were pissed and it took all of my restraint not to ask the kitchen to Waiting this Bastard.

As for the title...

The kitchen is doing water glasses. Instead of placing 3 trays side by side, they place 3 trays of glass like a goddamn cake. Dirty tray bottom on lip of glass. So. Knowing how disgusting that is, I take them back to the kitchen. Tell the chef they need to redo these trays and they know damn well they can't stack trays.
The chef is tired. I'm tired.

The place I’m at is a super popular family owned place. We get slammed every single night which is good! But also bad some nights. We don’t have sections, we do rotation.

All this is happening with tables scattered from one side of the restaurant to another.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hey servers!  
I'm a host at a breakfast restaurant, and we get super busy most days, waitlists probably thursday-sunday. I am also normally the only host, regardless of how busy it is. I'm the only ""actual"" host, the rest are just bussers who are in highschool and just work when they can. This place just opened so we're all kinda on the same level (no seniority within the restaurant), I wanted to be a host because I feel the income is more predictable. I have a few questions about random day-to-day stuff that I feel are weird in my restaurant, and want to see how others operate. 

1. Do you let your host know if you're cut? I'll go to seat a table and servers get visibly annoyed and tell me they're cut. How in the world am I to know that? Is that normally on the management? I'll always happily assign the table to another server but I'd prefer to avoid the situation altogether obviously. 
2. Do you expect the host to bus all the tables? A few servers will pick up their tip, and not touch a single dish. Being the only host, and sometimes without any bussers, this really causes people to pile up at the door. We weren't too busy the other day, but because I was the only host and there were no bussers, there was a 20 minute wait list because a few servers would not bus their tables. We also pre-set our tables, so bussing and pre-setting a table entirely on my own can take up to ten minutes if it's a big one. Obviously, causing a backlog of people and a lot of empty tables. If I were to approach these servers about how this makes it hard for me to do my job, what would be a good way to go about it? I don't want to be rude but it frustrates me to nooooooo end.
3. If you pre-set tables: Is this the host's job? For us it was never really delegated, but some servers come up to me and say something like ""hey. Can you set up table 8. Thanks."" Like, not a question. Then go just stand there in the host booth and hang out. Like why????? I have people I need to seat, you have no tables. Can't you at least assist??? Is that a fair way to feel?

I actually really like this job, but being new to the formal restaurant industry I am not sure if these are like normal things I should just shut up and deal with or if they're worth bringing up.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So tonight we went to a local restaurant my family frequents at least 4 times a month.  The service is never great per se, but we love the food and have never had any major problems. There tends to be an ever evolving rotation of staff due to the small town vibe of the restaurant, so sometimes it can be lacking, but I never tip below 20% wherever I go. 

So tonight we decided to head there. Made a reservation for 7:30. The restaurant stared small but has been picking up in business lately which as a local we love to see. 

Arrived and was sat at 7:29 by the hostess. Decided beforehand we wanted to order an appetizer immediately as sometimes they bring apps and dinner at the same time. 

7::30- menus on table, no one from staff comes to table. Mind you it is fairly busy, staff rotates a lot and it’s busy. It’s a BYOB and no one has come yet to the table.  

7:45 -  decide to raid the station that had a wine opener and wine glasses. Servers at all tables around us, our menus still in the table. No one has even laid eyes on us for 15 minutes. 

8:00 - it’s been 30 minutes. At this point it became a game to see if anyone would pay attention to us. At this point two waitresses and the hostess that sat us have walked past at least 5 times each. Thank god for wine. 

8:10 - I haven’t eaten all day. We wanted to see how long we could go before anyone would notice we existed, but I was too hungry at that point. I walked over to the hostess at the front Mt and let her know we were there for 4o minutes and still had no service. She immediately took care of us. It was odd because she wound up getting us our water, taking our order, bringing the food, etc. 

To my point...  we have had nothing but good experiences there before tonight. I would never bring this up on social media about the place or staff or anything and the food that came out was awesome like always. I guess my question is...

1. How did we sit for 40 minutes without getting noticed at all by like 4 staff walking by multiple times?

2. As a server, what would you expect as a tip percentage-wise if it was a hostess doing everything?

Again I am not bringing staff down. I love interacting with staff and typically 20% is my minimum tip.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I get a table just before getting ready to leave. Figure I’ll drop some waters and get some apps/beer out before I transfer the table to the server coming in a few minutes. Get a couple beer/drink orders and check IDs. All good except for one who shows me a picture of his passport. 

“Cool, I don’t think I can take that let me check with my manager.”

His. Face. Drops. 

Check with her turns out he’s tried at every bar in the building and rejected each time. 

I grab the drinks that I could serve and let the guy know “Hey man you tried everywhere else, but we all follow the same thing.”  Secondary server gets there and i transfer and let her know what’s going on. Another girl at the table attempts to order a beer for him and she gets shut down.

What the fuck is this bullshit, is this normal? I work in a mom and pop Mexican restraunt, it's a small place with 20 tables total but it can get busy. To give you an idea, on weekdays there is usually one person working foh from 9 to 3, but no more than 2 people working front of house (serving, bar, busing, hosting the whole 9 yards) the whole day. 3 on weekend evenings.

I opened for lunch at 10 but the closing servers from the night before hadn't set any of the tables and had completed only half of the closing list side work so I was behind from the start. Around noon and I had 6 tables and a few at the bar, I was doing ok, but still behind. The kitchen had lots of new cooks but stuff was mostly coming out right and on time. Then my boss told me about the golden girls.

A 14 top with ALL individual checks. What the fuck?!

These old ladies started pouring in and collecting like a swarm in the back room with our biggest table. Karen after Karen (no joke 2 legal name Karen's in this squad) the book/knitting/ gossip/casual alcoholism team assembled. 

Of course they all wanted different cocktails, nearly one of every variety, I smiled back tears as I flipped my notepad over for each individual check, knowing the next 3 hours will be unpleasant at best. After taking all their orders I made the drinks as fast as possible while still looking out for my other tables. Every time I returned to the 14 they were chatting away and totally ignored me even if they asked about ingredients etc minutes ago... when they ordered anything they were picky at best.

However after they had all left (mind you I was still occupied with 4 other tables) there were 2 checks still unpaid! What the fuck? I honestly dont know if these crones were too senile for self awareness or if they just didn't give a fuck. 

The server coming in next at 3pm calls in saying hes gonna be 30 min late, comes in an hour late and complains that silverware isnt rolled, not all the tables are set etc... so I take my 30 minutes (finally) and fantasize about driving away.

I come back and the shit show resumes. The designated bartender cant keep up with orders, the kitchen is full of new people and everyone but me is falling behind. I run food for other people, I pre bus tables in other sections. But the ""designated bartender"" (and owner's daughter) for the ENTIRE restraunt is busy talking to people at the bar instead of making MY drinks (which I'm not allowed to make myself because ShEs The bARtEndER AfTer SiX oN tHe WEekENd) and we have to tip her out for it. So all my drinks come out super late, I dont get good tips.

After things settle down chef comes out and talks to everyone about how they're doing a shitty job (confirmed with him later he was NOT talking about me). And all said and done I didn't make more than my other hourly job as a barista.

When I work here I dissociate super hard so I'm an emotonless robot outside of putting on a show for my tables. I like sales, but what the fuck even is this? How is everyone outside me and the head chef so incompetent? 

I put in my 2 weeks tonight as I applied to the bar I got a drink at after work (I am certain I will get the job). Chef was sad and wants me to stay, he knows how I feel but how can I still work here? I love the restraunt but loathe the coworkers. I cant make good money if I cant give good service. 

Serving is weird, how can people be so incompetent? I kinda just want to go work in a warehouse now and listen to podcasts all day, maybe I should try sales next 🤷‍♂️

Edit &amp; update: I did forget to mention that it turns out the tickets for the drinks that night were being sent to the wrong printer so the bartender was doing the best she could but missed a good deal of drinks. 

I ended up staying at the restraunt, the owners value my hard work which is rare for service industry. They are turning over a lot of staff that was causing problems and giving me priority, so I'm happy here for now. But the biggest reason is the money.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I dunno why, but I’ve been in a mood where I’ve reminisced all of my cringey experiences in the industry. This particular story places #2 in my top three, worst experiences. 

I was a hostess at the time. A server working with a party table was pretty upset with them. From what I recall, it was an issue with trying to play “Spin the Wheel of Comping” as well as oddly needing refills every second on gallon-sized drinks. Not to mention that two parents were heavily drinking our “Big A$$ Margaritas” as they had to take an infant home. I’m sure the server could tell a better story on that. This is my hostess story. 

I was obligated to clean tables after people left. And boy, oh boy, this was incomparable to any table I’ve had to clean. Clearly, the customers did not allow the table to prebus (we knew which servers actively prebussed or did not; this server prebuses), so I was left with a table covered with more plates and bowls than with... table. Not to mention that the chairs needed some deep scrubbing at this point. 

I was stacking the plates immune to any other smell than the smell of salsa and guacamole. But something caught the corner of my eye. A ginormous, brown, seeping diaper smack dab where those drunk parents were sitting. Quickly, I grab two rags together, tying them into a bandana. I wrap it around my nostrils to get to work. With some napkins, I lifted up the diaper hastily disposing of it into the trash can in the women’s restroom... by the baby changing station.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I was working at restaurant that served wings, both boneless and bone-in. Sometimes, customers would order chicken tenders and have them spun in sauce, as opposed to the sauce coming on the side to dip in.

We had just had a meeting during which we got to try new menu items and to discuss changes, one of which being that we  would no longer allow customers to order their chicken tenders spun in sauce. 

During slow shifts when we didn't have a hostess on shift to take to go orders, whoever got to the phone first both placed the order for the customer and checked them out when they arrived.

The woman wanted tenders spun in sauce and I informed her that we were no longer allowed to place these orders and offers alternatives. She was rude before I even told her this so I didn't expect her to be easy about it. 

She wasn't and argued that she had always ordered them that way. I apologized her and again informed her that the change came from the general manager and I wasn't able to place her order as she wanted it. I got tired of arguing with her and told her I would put her on the phone with my manager. 

Of course, my manager agrees to do it for her and gives the phone back to me. Cool. I do what I'm told to do and my manager doesn't have my back. No surprise there.

Longish story. 

I am a server at the hut of pizzas. The passed few months (winter in upstate NY) We've been relatively slow. Probably never more than 200 tickets in a day. 

Anyway, im the closer and I had a table ready and waiting when I get there at 6 PM. From then on I had tables. Carryout was a 30 min wait, delivery was even more slammed, so you can imagine the wait for dining room. 

My 4th table orders a Large HT Meat Lover. Put their order in. Have 1000000 things on my mind and am running around like I've lost my head. 

A Large pan Meat Lover pops up in the server rack and I don't think, just take. It (obviously) ended up being NOT MY PIZZA. It was my midshifters (JT) pizza for a table who had already been waiting a while. I felt horrible. She goes out and explains what happened, and they say they dont mind, they'll just take my tables Hand tossed Meat LVer. My tables order was 4 tickets behind hers so it was a bit more of a wait.

To make matters worse. My tables ticket was bumped prematurely, so THE HAND TOSSED MEAT LOVER WAS NEVER MADE. JT goes back, makes the pizza herself, and throws it in the oven. 

In all they waited more than an hour for their pizza.

Her table took it in good stride. Good spirited older men. We still comped their entire meal. I went over myself and apologized for it happening and they were joking with me and laughing about it. 

HAPPY ENDINGS:

Before comp, their check was 24 something. They tipped JT 7 bucks. 

They came back in today (Friday 2/21) got the other midshifter, JN, and got another Large Pan Meat Lover. JN was also there Valentines day so she knew what went down. She let's me know they are here and jokes ""don't steal this one okay"". Then she actually offers for me to run it and I scoop it up, bring it to the table and sit and joke with them for a minute about stealing this one and running away with it, leader of the group playfully brandished a fork at me. 

High five to them for being so understanding and cool about it. 

TLDR; stole another table/servers pizza on accident. Her table said yes to taking my tables pizza. My tables pizza ended up never being put in. In all, her table waited about an hour for their pizza, got their meal comped, still tipped over 20% of their original total and to this day continue to joke about it with us.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Some people...

Two days ago, we had a guy come into our restaurant in order to buy two of our fish sandwiches that we have on sale, but he wanted them 'fresh'.  No problem.  I can see why you can have a bad experience with a sandwich that makes you want to ensure their freshness.  I tell the fryer to drop two fresh for him and finish his order.  However, about a minute and a half later the sandwiches come forward and he majorly flips over ""I know that it takes longer than that to fix the fish!"" and ""I want them FRESH!!"".  I tried to explain to him that we'd had some fish sandwiches sell right before he'd come in and so they were in the fryer when he'd ordered.  They were INDEED fresh.  He continued to complain and finally I just looked at him and said ""Do you want me to have them make them again, starting with new fish?""  He did a deathglare at me and took the sandwiches and said ""I'll take them, but if they aren't fresh then I'll be back!!""  He didnt return that day.

Today I was working again when he came back.  He wanted another two fish sandwiches dropped fresh.  (I guess the last two passed his picky fish standards).  I went to the fryer myself.  We had two fish that were just less than a minute from coming up, but I stated to them I wasn't going to listen to him witch and moan more so just drop two right now for him.  My manager even offered to fix those two for him since they literally came up, but he made a snide comment about taking an old fish and dropping it for a short while in the fryer for a 'fresh order'.

&lt;p&gt;I dropped off your check and you did the same. As you were praying for me, I had a feeling of peace. It was a feeling I hadn&amp;#39;t had for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You both were soooo nice! Keep doing what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

I work at a small mom and pop. We are one of the most popular restaurants in my city. We work our asses off, 15 hours a day open to close. Half the kitchen is on overtime.

No one is on their phone or goofing off. Everyone is trying their best. But we're humans. We make mistakes. We do our best to correct them. 

But no. Fucking Karen and fucking Chad are American and deserve the world! All the kisses, hugs, and praises galore.

You want free shit constantly, because it's your birthday and the world has been blessed with your presence, and this restaurant as well. How would we be open without you?!

You ordered a steak well done and then sent it back for being ""dry."" Our kitchen is not as fast as McDonald's and you're starving to death! So sorry. 

You're expecting to be wowed, because you're bored, and you're actual existence is rather meaningless, so the smallest infraction at a small town local restaurant warrants a review that smears the reputation of a restaurant owned by a man with a wife and four kids in college so you can feel important.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Obligatory mobile not native etc. Long one incoming

 Necessary backstory: I live in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where our official language is Dutch. I am Dutch but not white, otherwise fluent without accent. I work in a Japanese restaurant with mainly Japanese people working there, so our main shop language is English, for the few co-workers who don't speak Japanese and the many customers who don't. The racism in this story isn't directed towards me, but my Japanese coworkers, the lovely Sen in particular (not her real name, but she reminder me of a Ghibli character so). She speaks Japanese only, with only basic English skills. 

 To start off the night, there was this lovely family of 3 sitting in a far corner. This one was more minor and light-hearted, to lift the mood before the fiasco to come. I was busy cleaning the table next to this lovely family, when I hear the son (about 12) loudly complain to his mom why they're in a Japanese restaurant, where all the people don't even speak Dutch (Sen had tended to them earlier) and had weird accents. Why they couldn't just go to somewhere with actual tasty food. Mom didn't really seem to care and completely ignored the whining, going on about how wonderful a different Japanese restaurant was. In the end the son had barely touched his food when his Mom and Sister decided to leave, but he angrily tried to stay behind to eat more, because it tasted so good. 





 Now onto our bigger story, which probably disgusted me more than it should, but my disgust was confirmed by customers who had been there the entire time. At this point it was getting rather late, so after 8PM, and this group of 6 comes waltzing in. Luckily for them there was only one other table filled so they could actually sit down. They looked like a bunch of men just finished with a week of physical labour, ready to get drunk.

 We greet them with the standard いたらしゃい (welcome) and they respond with *muah*. Off to a great start. Sen tends to their table and immediately they restart the conversation with more kisses and copying anything she says that sounds remotely funny to them. Sen, being the amazing human she is, responds with a small laugh and proceeds to take their order. Because the amount of beer they order is more than she can take by herself I assist her, but the moment we return to their table, they're back to making sexually tinted comments about her. The kicker: they're speaking only in Dutch from now on. She leaves before I do, cleaning up a bit after some beer spilled on an adjacent table. They start loudly (and I mean really Loudly) talking about how Sen is clearly putting up an act to refuse to speak to them. About how she can surely speak Dutch and understand their comments. This continues all the way up until they finally check out, which takes ages, considering some of them were too dumb to even remember what they ordered. 

 I go to clean their table, and it was probably the most disgusting state I've ever seen any table be left behind in. The floor got as much noodles as they probably did, considering they barely ate half. It took extra strong cleaner to even get any cleaning done. When I return to the counter, they're still busy making comments, figuring out who pays for what. They turn their attention to me, asking me if I came from somewhere nearby (I have no idea, it was slurred and for all I know he could he asking about my school, I'm not from the area). Not planning on giving him the satisfaction he wanted, I just smiled at the one asking and responded in Japanese that I had no clue what he said. He turns his attention back to Sen and suddenly they all try to bribe her to speak Dutch. It took me standing next her at the counter with an annoyed smile (I'm a lot bigger built than she is, and a lot less cute, Japanese looking) to finally get them to lay it off and pay. They didn't tip, of course (not mandatory in the Netherlands for any Americans who wonder)

 When the table that had the horrendous fate of sitting next to them paid about half an hour later, they were appalled for us, and apologized for not stepping in. Apparently they heard a lot worse things than I did, but they didn't want to have to repeat it for us.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work at a busy coffee shop next to a hospital. We share a building with one hospital financial department. A woman came in about 10 minutes ago to see if someone had turned in a phone, as her phone locator said it was in our building.

,TalesFromYourServer,"By Current Journalism Major (who knows how the real Redditors like their stories - AP Style)

I spent my entire career as a server over four different locations, all corporate. This current one is arguably the best job I've ever had, (yes, still young and learning, cut me some slack), and it's unrivaled with about every restaurant near it.  It drives the community.

Today, though, after a solid four months of ""hitting the ground running"", I fell. And this fall was momentous, both literally and figuratively.

Put simply, my job is built into an over-priced, super-faux-luxurious, plaza-apartment-strip that mimics Times Square - but for families and the elderly with lots of money to waste.

Right next door to my job is a theater that occasionally holds plays and operas that attract DEFCON-1 customers. These customers come in waves, they travel together as if they're hyenas, and act no differently. Today, I was the sacrificial lamb.

It all started with 4 elderly ladies that came in five minutes before happy hour ended. We granted them an extension - unbeknownst to us that this party was about to multiply. By 6:30 - 30 minutes after our happy hour ended, the Karen party of four became a party of 34 - all separate checks.

The server who was unfortunate enough to be paired with me had to survive the onslaught of demands that since the original four ladies received happy hour, that all of them by extension, deserve the same right. My manager allowed it.

Everything seemed to run smoothly, we got the drinks in, and had it by seat number. Veteran servers, you already see where I messed up - should've done it by name, and it only gets worse...

Fueled by a Bang Energy to the skull, I was pumping out more waters with lemon and club sodas with lime faster than Usain Bolt can dart the 100-meter dash. My co-worker was getting plates and pre-drops ready to go. I was confident, nothing was going to mess this up. I headed to the bar and started gliding back with about 15 glasses of wine, all put in the same seat order.

That was, until my drink ticket betrayed me, right near the table.  It fell down and my nonslip sketchers were defeated, as myself, the tray, and wine cascaded to the floor. I was doused, from head-to-toe, in happy hour cabs and pinot noirs. Embarrassed, pissed, and slightly frightened that how much of a comp that was going to be, I picked myself back up, and silently walked to re-ring in every wine glass.

The Karens saw their opening, moaning and groaning over my misfortune, asking to speak to the manager as to why their wine was taking so long after seeing me at the POS system a foot away scrambling - first round, completely comped. Karen 1 - Me 0.

My coworker brought the new wine out, and the musical chairs began. Suddenly, ""Seat 1"" became ""Seat 15"", and my coworker and I became ""Super Weeded"". If this was football, what was coming would be equivalent to a JV high school team faced off against the Kansas City Chiefs today.

We tried to rearrange everything as the Karens picked at their heavily-modified apps/entrees with their unnecessarily long nails and complained about the noise in the restaurant. Some ladies found it fitting to knock over their waters on other's foods, resulting in rapid ""FLY PLZ GOD FLY"" remakes being sent to a BOH that was already drowning.

Suddenly, a movement began to check the time at the table - 15 minutes until doors open to their show. My coworker and I started to scramble to piece everything together as the ladies started to rise from their seats and surround us at the POS, credit cards in hand. My coworker disappeared to get the manager as the ladies heckled me to no end, utilizing every slander in the book as to why I needed a few minutes to gather their 34 separate checks. I tried explaining that no one made us aware of a show, and I was rushing it out as quickly as I could. My manager intervened and slowly became aware that his server now belonged to the Karens. 

Some wound up walking out on their check, causing a scene and others berated us until they paid for random items, but most importantly, I was overwhelmed and ready to just accept my fate. I thought I was finito, done, 86'd, whatever. I didn't even care that my coworker and I made less than 10% on a $500+ bill that was accounted for.

My beloved manager took the time, while comping an outrageous amount of items - to calm me down and let me know that everything was going to be fine. What felt like a disaster soon became a free meal and a sticker on the incentive wall next to my name. I got to keep the job, eat a meal, do my sidewalk and head home.

Karen 34 - Me 35.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’m a server at a busy casual dining restaurant. To give you an idea, we did $136k Friday -Monday on V-day weekend. We don’t have a tip share system, and the amount we tip out to bussers, food runners, expos, and bartenders is up to the individual server.

I tip out based on the “10% rule”. 10% of my tips go to my busser, 1% of my food sales go to the food runners, 1% food sales also to expo, and 10% alcohol sales to the bartender. If I have $1000 in food sales &amp; $80 in alcohol for the night and make $160, busser gets $16, $20 divided btw expo &amp; food runner, and $8 to bartender. When I train new servers, I walk them through this process so they have a system to know how much to tip out. 

However, I know for a fact several servers aren’t tipping out AT ALL! They are the first ones to complain about shitty tips and show everyone when they get stiffed, then they leave without giving anything to their support staff. 

IMO, this is fucking unacceptable. I’ve worked in restaurants for almost 10 years, working my way up from a busser &amp; Expo. I know how hard these ppl work &amp; how frustrating it is when servers dont appreciate the work they do.

So my question for this sub is what can I do?? I’ve posted about this on our Facebook page. I’ve spoken up during our pre-shift meetings. I’ve even personally called out individual servers to their face when I know they didn’t tip out after the previous shift. They always give the same excuse; “I didn’t make shit”, “I did tip out I gave it to x&amp;y”, “OMG I totally forgot I’ll give them extra tonight”. 

I’ve tried everything but nothing has changed. When I heard our best busser left V-day, after working 8 hours, with $23 (5 servers in his section completely stiffed him) I decided that was enough and made it my mission to fight for these ppl. 

So Reddit, what’s the best way to get these selfish servers to take care of their support staff??

EDIT: corrected tip % of food runners &amp; expo, mean 1% of food sales, not 10%.

,TalesFromYourServer,"On mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues. First post on here as well but damn I need to vent.

I work at a nice restaurant that specializes in fresh food and great cocktails. When I was hired they made a great deal about how their dress code was relaxed and all about how they want their employees to be able to have their individuality. Sounds great right? It was one of the highlights of this job to me, especially since the past few I've had have had strict dress codes.

Fast forward a few months and management springs on us that we'll be wearing aprons right? No big deal to me- I don't mind being protected from random food- and accept that paying for an apron is unavoidable. However they neglected to tell us that we would also be SEVERELY altering dress code. I have bought nice clothes only for the purpose of using them to go to work and now most (if not all) are not allowed. I don't think it's right to hire someone with the promise of one thing and then turn around and do the exact opposite.

I understand that businesses change and that you just have to roll with it but I'm not financially in a place where I can just go out and buy a whole new wardrobe, especially since I already have for this job. Not to mention in the decade they've been open nothing like this has happened. It just feels like I've been blindsided and there is not shit I can do about it.

Managers at these corporate restaurants never have their servers back, luckily we got a new guy that doesn’t take shit from nobody.

We have this system that you can order your food and when you sit down it “should put your food in” granted I’ve worked at this place for three years and I’ve never seen the system in action nor have I ever had someone order from it.

This guy comes in with his wife, both were totally rude I greeted them and asked for their drinks, he responds “you should know what I ordered fucker” in my mind I wanted to spit in his face and tell him to take a hike but of course I kept my shit together. “I’m sorry sir I said, that system is stuff getting the bugs out but I can’t take your order now” he responds by calling me an ass hole and a fucker. At this point with only 3 min of communication with other this guy I was done with him treating me like I’m not a human trying to make a living. 
I go to the host stand and my manager tells me that on our site it says “under construction” in the pre order section meaning it doesn’t work, in big red letters this was written.
Finallly I take his order, his food comes out and everything was ok. He then walks over to the host stand while I’m standing there and says “I’m not paying for this and points at the host and says “this stupid bitch should have told us that we would be waiting an hour for our food” mind you that the wait was 45 min to get seated and he got his food within 10-15 min after sitting down. 
I stepped in the middle and said you can’t be calling people names like that and he got up into my face and started verbally abusing me again. 
 My manager steps in and he gets up into his face!! My manager is a huge guy and shouldn’t be fucked with. 
The guy is now demanding that his food be comped and he wants the number for corporate to get myself and the host fired. My manager responds “how about you get the fuck out of my restaurant and quit verbally abusing my employees” 
He then walked out and said “I’m never coming back” 
Response from the employees “k”

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a post made not too long before I started typing this about a creepy manager, but the post became too long to comment so I've made a post. I'd like to address the industry plague of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

I'm a busboy but I do the job of three different people but I thrive in high-pressure situations so I frequently step in to help servers and bartenders when I get ahead.  I'm overworked and overpaid. That's a doozy of a story in and of itself and I've addressed it in post history, but this is to address female servers and the gross harassment they endure on a regular basis just to keep food on their table. This might turn out to be a rant so I hope yall brought the reading glasses.

&amp;#x200B;

The particular restaurant I work at has a reputation with hiring attractive young servers and literally only hires **FEMALE** servers and bartenders. There has not been a male server or bartender in the 15 year history of the place and my manager, the general manager who is closely related to the owner gets away with everything and I just want to get it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've become very close with a few of the more *extroverted* servers whose actions may well be considered flirting when alcohol is involved. However, my manager has taken it too far and has deliberately **told** them to come to the basement to make out, or to take body shots off-camer*a.  In one scenario he threatened a server (my girlfriend's) job if she did not come to hook up with him.* He (General Manager) is currently dating a Bartender openly and on several occasions now, I and the female servers have lied to cover his creepy ass.

&amp;#x200B;

On our Holiday party, he ditched his girlfriend and followed us to my car, where I drove all of us home because he literally would not leave my car, and the police would start watching the lot soon. We had a lot more drinks at her place, and He was hoping for me to leave and being so drunk, I was about to since I had an early morning, but I got a bad vibe and my girlfriend and I, with another female server friend, slept in my girlfriend's bed while he rode the couch ;) . He called his uber shortly after we went to bed and left without a peep. At the same Holiday party, **I had to physically remove him from my girlfriend as she's crying and verbally refusing his advance.** He quickly warns me never to touch him and tries to sell it as some sort of joke and game that they've had since before I started there. I don't think so. Disrespect to me aside, I'm not going to let any man touch my female friends or girlfriend for that matter, I don't give a fuck if he's my boss or the President.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen many girls just leave the place, but we have a baby and she can't afford to lose the job at the moment. I'm a college senior as well so I don't have the time to find a new one. We're both finding new jobs eventually, but I just don't want him to get away with this anymore. So many good people have left that place because of him and it's sad because I've lost many friends in the Year and 1/2  that I've worked there, simply because I don't see them anymore and we drift apart. It's UNBELIEVABLE that I have to set the example on how to act when I'm 22 and he's 47

&amp;#x200B;

It's mostly our word against his, but we can prove some actions, and others have been vouched for by many people, not just a segregated clique of coworkers. Here's a juicy list of his disgusting actions.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT WE CAN PROVE:**

* Screenshotted Text from boss threatening female server's job if she does not make out with him
* Video showing boss grabbing server's ass as she's crying and pushing him away
* Video showing server shake her head multiple times as my boss keeps on trying to get her to take a lime out of his mouth, which she then does

**OTHER SHITTY THINGS HE'S DONE**

* Snorted Cocaine off server's breasts
* Smoked Weed with his subordinates (legal state so no trouble other than the owner frowning on it)
* Comments about employee's uniform (Suggestions, Compliments, etc.)
* Pressured former server into Oral Sex
* Requested Nudes from Servers
* Demanded Tip-Outs from Servers even though he is a salaried employee (This is illegal)
* Verbally abused and demeaned employees when they question his management ability
* Pressured Employees into body shots
* Sent dick pics to servers **(it's fucking tiny)**

&amp;#x200B;

If you got this far I thank you. I'd like to hear some honest advice about how I can proceed. I can't go to the owner, because they are related and he is fully aware of the sexual harassment and chooses not to lift a finger, even when he witnesses it through camera footage. I believe the owner likely holds this above his head because although he's a POS, my GM is one of the Owner's hardest working employees and frequently does work outside the restaurant when not on the clock. Anyway, sorry for the length and I hope it's entertaining, but this is a reality me and my girlfriend have had to live with for combined years. It was fun in the beginning but things are taking a turn for the worst, and I need to protect myself and my baby momma if shit hits the fan.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WE CAN PROVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshotted Text from boss threatening female server&amp;#39;s job if she does not make out with him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video showing boss grabbing server&amp;#39;s ass as she&amp;#39;s crying and pushing him away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video showing server shake her head multiple times as my boss keeps on trying to get her to take a lime out of his mouth, which she then does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER SHITTY THINGS HE&amp;#39;S DONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snorted Cocaine off server&amp;#39;s breasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoked Weed with his subordinates (legal state so no trouble other than the owner frowning on it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments about employee&amp;#39;s uniform (Suggestions, Compliments, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressured former server into Oral Sex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requested Nudes from Servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demanded Tip-Outs from Servers even though he is a salaried employee (This is illegal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbally abused and demeaned employees when they question his management ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressured Employees into body shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent dick pics to servers &lt;strong&gt;(it&amp;#39;s fucking tiny)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got this far I thank you. I&amp;#39;d like to hear some honest advice about how I can proceed. I can&amp;#39;t go to the owner, because they are related and he is fully aware of the sexual harassment and chooses not to lift a finger, even when he witnesses it through camera footage. I believe the owner likely holds this above his head because although he&amp;#39;s a POS, my GM is one of the Owner&amp;#39;s hardest working employees and frequently does work outside the restaurant when not on the clock. Anyway, sorry for the length and I hope it&amp;#39;s entertaining, but this is a reality me and my girlfriend have had to live with for combined years. It was fun in the beginning but things are taking a turn for the worst, and I need to protect myself and my baby momma if shit hits the fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jolt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So, I work at a steakhouse. It’s not super fancy by any means but it’s popular. Monday night I was scheduled in a 4 table section nothing new. We were down a server and the hosts up front are new so they aren’t that good at seating. the front of house was tied up in window because the kitchen manager wasn’t done her morning prep at 6pm. It was a slow steady Monday and everyone was standing around. I had 2 tables and the server beside me had a 10 top. The host tried giving her an 8 top 5 minutes later and she hasn’t been serving very long. She asks me to take it, it’s a few young kids so a glorified 5 top honestly.. sure!. As I’m taking their drink order I see them seat me 2 more 4top tables, filling my section. Then proceed to seat me a 7 top all adult party in a pick up table that’s also mine according to the computer. I ask managers for help but they were all tied up. Meanwhile the server beside me still has a 10 top and 3 empty tables. My first two tables pay and leave as I’m getting the drinks and they seat them almost immediately. I had no idea what was going on but I just kinda had to deal with it.

Sorry for the formatting, I am on mobile. 

This happened yesterday during our busy lunch rush hours. 
I work at a family owned restaurant and am the only waitress. We are usually super packed and busy during lunch hours and it can be very overwhelming at times, but most of my customers understand and are patient. The one and only most difficult person ever decided to come dine in during this busy time, and decided to bring a friend along. 

Usually when I bring a menu, I grab our utensils wrapped in a napkin and then bring glasses of water to the table afterwards. But this difficult lady always...ALWAYS give that ‘disgusted’ look at the cups and says ‘I’m not drinking that, I want it in a to-go cup along with plastic utensils’ ok, no problem. But today we were very low on plastic cups and have to save them for to-go orders only, I explained this to her and she kept the ‘disgusted’ facial expression and says ‘I don’t care, I’m not going to drink off of that cup’ I have about 8 other tables to take care of so didn’t want to argue with her so I went and fixed her a drink in a plastic cup and brought it to her, once I sat it down her friend says ‘oh I want it in a to go cup as well’ I repeated ‘I know you heard me tell her that we are low on plastic cups’ her friend gives me a stare and says ‘I still want one’ by this time I’m getting annoyed and asked to take their order and then turned to the difficult woman and said ‘everytime you come here you are always so difficult!’ And walked off to put her order in and take care of my other customers. 

While I was busy ringing up a door dash order, the friend came up to the register and in a very rude tone says ‘Do you have any real silver ware?’ I said ‘your silverware is on your table wrapped in a napkin’ and she looked annoyed and said ‘I meant plastic silverware’ I told the customer in front of me to wait one second then go and grab the plastic utensils and hand it to the rude friend whom snatched it out of my hand and walked off. The customer in front of me said ‘wow she is very disrespectful’ I just laughed and told her ‘if only you knew...’ 


Later on after I was done ringing everyone up and made sure everyone had their food, I went to check up on all of my tables, once I reached the difficult woman and her friend, I asked ‘is everything ok, can I get you anything else?’ The friend replied in the same rude tone ‘yeah we’re fine NOW, thanks for finally asking!’ And the difficult woman says ‘I don’t like your customer service today’. I stood there and said ‘I’m sorry.’ 

I really wanted to say ‘if you’re so disgusted about our food or hygiene, why bother coming back all the time? Just stay home and cook or go elsewhere! I always go out of my way to make sure you are satisfied with your order, but this time you and your friend were just too much! I am no longer going out of my way for you specifically because I work for tip only and no matter how hard I try to please you, you are never satisfied and never even leave a tip!’

The reason I said she is always difficult is because she is never satisfied. She’d order a fried rice and ask for the chicken on the side, which is extra work for the chef, especially while we were super busy. Sometimes the meal isn’t spicy enough for her so she’d send it back and have us remake it to her liking. Sometimes she even mix up her order and have us take the plate back because she ‘didn’t order that, she meant to order something else’. And aside from all of that, she ALWAYS have that ‘disgusted’ smirk and look when she comes in to our restaurant...

,TalesFromYourServer,"I've been working at a restaurant for five years at a performance venue. I like my regulars, schedule, money etc.


We got a new manager recently and another co-worker pointed out that they started auto-deducting 30 minutes for a break per shift across the board for servers, kitchen and bussers. I figure my wage is like 5 something an hour and the meat is my gratuities but still it bugs me. The kitchen makes a higher hourly and so do the bussers so they're taking the heat of it. I get to sit down for ten minutes unless I'm on a working break or a longer one if there's a longer first half of the performance. The kitchen takes less of a break and the bussers never stop moving.


I asked the manager about this and they said legally they're supposed to provide a break after a certain number of hours. That's how they do it at another restaurant the company owns and they're surprised we weren't doing it at my restaurant. That other restaurant is also newer, mind you.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Firstly, sorry for the lengthy rant.

Okay so, I started working at this Japanese restaurant in my home town for about 6 months. It's a small place (probably seats around 40-60 depending on the night) and it's really close to where I live so the commute is good. I started working here because I liked the place and thought it would be cool to learn more about Japanese food and culture. At first I didn't think anything was particularly bad about the place; the food I got after my shifts was decent, and although I was making minimum wage at the start, I was assured this was just because I was in training and that I'd start to make tips after I got more familiarized with the menu etc.

It was only after I made the transition from ""trainee"" to ""server"" that things started going downhill.

I was told that ""per their policy"" I would start out making only 60% of my cut of the tips (while they payed me only $3 an hour). I was assured that I could work my way up to 100% by working and getting better at my job. It was kinda weird but I was willing to put the time in to earn more tips.

Since then, I have worked there 6 more months and am pretty familiar with every aspect of the restaurant. I serve multiple tables, hand write every ticket, have a good understanding of the menu, work double shifts when they need me, do the dishes (because they have yet to hire a washer for more than a week), prep food, clean the entire restaurant (and bathrooms), come in on time, and am generally pretty agreeable to work with. Also since I started working there the place has become incredibly understaffed and I've been picking up everyone's shifts to compensate.

Despite all of this I still *only make* 70% of the tips I earn, and found out today that I'm technically not allowed to interact with cash in any way, despite having run the register for over a month at this point. I thought this seemed ridiculous and asked the manager directly about it (albeit through a translator as he speaks very little English). After a 45 minute discussion I discovered that apparently only waiters who are making 90% of their tips are allowed to interact with the money.  

I then asked how I might work toward making this, as I was already doing everything the ""100%"" were doing. The answer I got was a super runaround way of saying  that it's just whenever they decide to raise my tip percentage, and isn't actually based on my ability to work. Essentially everything I don't do in the restaurant is because either I'm not allowed to do it, or they refuse to teach me because that would mean paying me more. 

&amp;#x200B;

And as a side note; since I've started working there, the ""free meal"" I'm given has gone from proper meals on the menu, to [whatever this is](https://i.imgur.com/0WPHCBF.jpg).

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’m hopefully finally leaving the host trap. Yes, I agreed to be hired as a host almost a year ago for restaurant experience, as it made sense and i believed it would set me up for success. 

I’ve been working at the same place for a while, and have learned to navigate the POS, put out fires, compartmentalize, and so much more.

,TalesFromYourServer,"My job seems very hard to get fired from. I’m very concerned about a coworker of mine dealing with bullying. She’s like a little sister to me and I love her to death. 

Outside of work, a coworker asked us to hang out on Saturday. The problem is that we all have our own lives as this was a spur-of-the-moment invitation. Not only that, but our restaurant has a total of eight servers- there is never going to be a night that at least three servers in our friendship group of six will work together. Plans fell through even though my sister, me, and another coworker agreed to go. The other three were actually busy with other plans. 

The coworker in question “thanked” the three of us that agreed to go in a petty way after she decided to cancel the hangout. The coworker (my “adopted” sister) made a good point to tell this coworker that we need to work something new out in a kind way which is what initially led to the cancelation. Things seemed fine. Until that coworker (we will call A) began to bully my friend (B). 

B came in Sunday lacking a shirt since her partner accidentally had it. My lovely friend offered her a shirt in the car. At first A just made a salty comment like, “If I wore THAT, I’d be sent home!” It was dismissed by B since it was a simple and personal thing. 

But A continued to harass B by telling her, “Your rolls are showing in that shirt,” and kicking her while she was maneuvering to her tables. The physicalness ensued for the duration of the shift. My friend already told our GM and another manager about this issue. I’m personally worried they’ll interpret as a girl fight instead of it being legitimate bullying. B is a tenacious girl so it saddens me to see how upset she is about this. 

A bit of background with A. I’ve already had issues myself with A as I’ve noticed some emotional manipulation. She’d tell me she’s “fucking pissed at me” in such an irate voice that my timid ass gets scared. And then she’d creepily laugh telling me she was kidding. She also mentioned to me in passing how she’s stabbed people. But I ignore these things as it’s caused no issues with my serving behind jarring me for a moment. 

A has already had trouble with management over work-related issues, but I did state in my intro that it’s hard to get fired. She’s a very violent person (from my experience being in high school with her as well as work) and I’m worried that things will escalate. I know this bullying stemmed from the rejection of the get-together and I don’t want it to go any further. I do not want to go to my management fending for my friend since I know it’d look like I’m unreasonably targeting A. 

So I ask for advice from fellow servers that I know dealt with stupid drama: what can I do to protect my friend? If management does not persist in reprimanding A for current (there have been past) issues, what can I do to ensure my friend B is safe from harm?

It wouldn’t be so bad but it’s a day where we give stuff away with the meal, so that on top of 18 separate checks and the $$ given away that aren’t tipped on....well, it makes Mondays suck.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Let me preface this by saying I’m a bar manager of a small bar that has live music every weekend. I mostly just bartend since we don’t have many employees, but I can pull out the manager card when I need to. Some people don’t believe that I’m the manager since I look really young, but I do what I have to in order to keep the bar running smoothly. Sorry that this got long. 

I was working on Saturday night with one other bartender and no bar back since ours recently fell off a ladder and broke his leg. It was super busy and people were being semi-rude all night, but it was nothing too bad. Some lady freaked out over us losing all of our salt shakers so she couldn’t take her patron shot with salt, one guy said “I don’t know why you think she’s fat.” To his friend as I walked by, and just a bunch of people banging their glasses on the bar when they needed a refill even though both bartenders were clearly busy making other drinks. Just an average day. 

At the end of the night after the band was done some people asked us to turn on the jukebox and so we did and we turned it up loud enough for people to dance to, but still not too loud that people couldn’t easily be heard over it. A lady complained it was too quiet, but I let her know that after a certain time of night we don’t like to be too loud since we are attached to a hotel and guests have complained before. She didn’t like my answer, but she left to go back to her friends anyways. 

Cue to 2:15 and I turned the jukebox down to call last call and then I kept it at a low volume to start alerting people it was time to leave. The same lady who complained before came storming up to the bar and SCREAMED at me that she heard me say I hated this song and that’s why I turned off her music. I explained to her that I never said anything like that as I was busy helping customers and that I didn’t even turn her song off, I just lowered the volume of it, but she was hearing none of that. She continued to scream at me about the jukebox and how we are horrible servers and she has never been treated so poorly in her life. At this point, a customer came to my defense and said he was the one who said he didn’t like her song, but I had nothing to do with it. Safe to say, she didn’t believe him and continued to yell about how much money she spends here and how she’s going to talk to my manager about this. She’s never been treated so poorly in her life...blah blah blah. 


Now I would like to mention at this point that I’ve worked at this bar for 4 years and managed it for 1.5 years and I have NEVER seen her before. In fact, I saw her group walk in at 12:45 am and I didn’t see a single one of them come up to the bar to even order a drink all night. So I don’t know why she kept saying she spends so much money here when I’m pretty sure the only money she spent was on the jukebox.

She again asks for my name so she can report me in the most condescending tone I’ve ever heard and I let her know I’m the manager and I can take her complaint and she lost it all over again.

IF YOU DONT LIKE IT LEAVE!” She kind of startled at that and then tried to start complaining again so I yelled again “GET OUT!” Before she finally got the hint and left. 


The whole bar was pretty silent after that, but no one else complained. It probably wasn’t the best way to handle the situation but she wouldn’t let me get a word in edgewise and she didn’t believe anything I said anyways. It had been a long night and I was just very over it by the time she came up to the bar. She never did contact the bar owner.",t2_jip39,False,,0,False,Jukebox horror story,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_f5xrde,False,dark,,public,61,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,61,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1582084963.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying I’m a bar manager of a small bar that has live music every weekend. I mostly just bartend since we don’t have many employees, but I can pull out the manager card when I need to. Some people don’t believe that I’m the manager since I look really young, but I do what I have to in order to keep the bar running smoothly. Sorry that this got long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on Saturday night with one other bartender and no bar back since ours recently fell off a ladder and broke his leg. It was super busy and people were being semi-rude all night, but it was nothing too bad. Some lady freaked out over us losing all of our salt shakers so she couldn’t take her patron shot with salt, one guy said “I don’t know why you think she’s fat.” To his friend as I walked by, and just a bunch of people banging their glasses on the bar when they needed a refill even though both bartenders were clearly busy making other drinks. Just an average day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night after the band was done some people asked us to turn on the jukebox and so we did and we turned it up loud enough for people to dance to, but still not too loud that people couldn’t easily be heard over it. A lady complained it was too quiet, but I let her know that after a certain time of night we don’t like to be too loud since we are attached to a hotel and guests have complained before. She didn’t like my answer, but she left to go back to her friends anyways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue to 2:15 and I turned the jukebox down to call last call and then I kept it at a low volume to start alerting people it was time to leave. The same lady who complained before came storming up to the bar and SCREAMED at me that she heard me say I hated this song and that’s why I turned off her music. I explained to her that I never said anything like that as I was busy helping customers and that I didn’t even turn her song off, I just lowered the volume of it, but she was hearing none of that. She continued to scream at me about the jukebox and how we are horrible servers and she has never been treated so poorly in her life. At this point, a customer came to my defense and said he was the one who said he didn’t like her song, but I had nothing to do with it. Safe to say, she didn’t believe him and continued to yell about how much money she spends here and how she’s going to talk to my manager about this. She’s never been treated so poorly in her life...blah blah blah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to mention at this point that I’ve worked at this bar for 4 years and managed it for 1.5 years and I have NEVER seen her before. In fact, I saw her group walk in at 12:45 am and I didn’t see a single one of them come up to the bar to even order a drink all night. So I don’t know why she kept saying she spends so much money here when I’m pretty sure the only money she spent was on the jukebox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reiterated how I am sorry she is so mad about the jukebox, but again I do this every weekend and it wasn’t just her song that I had a problem with (I even liked the song she played, but that’s beside the point).

""No. And kokanee is a shitty beer that has no place being on tap."" They bought it as a joke thankfully and were fine, but were quite upset when I said the same thing about Bud Light, which we do have on tap.

It’s just subtler things that make me feel less valued while in uniform just for being a food server. I greet people, they ignore me, okay. People order and never even make eye contact. People don’t say please nor thank you. People leave their cash, cards, receipts, etc on the counter for me to grab instead of handing it to me (sometimes even when I literally have my hand stretched out). Some people don’t even make coherent sentences, it’s just fragments.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hello brethren, 
I’ve been working in restaurants since I was 16, (22 now), serving since I was 20, and I’ve only ever worked corporate. 
Recently I landed a gig at a smaller locally owned restaurant. Think of an upscale twist on your average pub.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work as a server and I get the most entitled selfish people you can ever deal with. I’ve had multiple occasions where the customer pulls some sort of play to make it more beneficial for them money wise.
For example I get these tables all the time. They order over 100$ worth of food, get 10$ off multiple times because they are reward members dropping the bill to around 70$, then they decide to use gift cards which takes an even bigger chunk out of the total, by the time they are done with their coupons their bill is 15$ going onto their card, and what do you know, I get a 20% tip on the 15, not the 100$ original bill. People need to learn that this is how we live, we don’t live off our hourly, tips are how we pay for all the necessities of life.

Kids: parents need to teach their kids how to tip if given good service, I’ve never had a young adult (ages 13-17) leave a tip anywhere close to 20%. 
They come in, make a mess and leave a tip that makes me say “ well fuck” and making me want to run out to them and say “here, take your .23 cents back that you left me on your 40$ bill” I can’t wait till they get a serving job and get put into the same situation they have put many other servers in.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I'm a server at a chain steakhouse that may or may not be associated with kangaroos. I need to let this out somewhere. This has literally been the worst weekend I've ever worked in a restaurant, and I spent one Valentines Day at the damn Melting Pot. 

**Valentines Day** itself, we had 2 servers call-in but still had a fairly smooth shift. Nobody was overwhelmed. Servers all had 4 tables apiece, myself with 5, and the hosts were pacing seating so the kitchen was busy but not crashing. The expo killed it. Everybody made money. 

**Saturday**, we have 11 servers on... with 3 table sections. We generally have 5-6 table sections. Cue disgruntled servers. We get tons of big parties all night, so now the few servers in areas that can accommodate them are borrowing the free-standing tables from other servers, hence cutting those people down to 2 tables. Now they've gone from grumbly to pissed off. 

I have a section where the middle table is essentially unseatable - it's a tiny 2-top sandwiched between two bigger tables, people refuse to be seated there. After 2.5 hours, I've had FOUR tables all night. My co-workers are the same nearby. They're in the high top bar area, again which people don't want to sit in. There's probably 3 servers who are actually busy &amp; the other 8 of us are twiddling our thumbs with our 2 tables at a time. 

Manager #1 decides he's assigning sidework tonight. Now, he's only worked here for about 6 months. Most of the waitstaff has been there for multiple years. There's an established way of doing things - sidework is done by in-time &amp; is assigned by the BOH closer. Tempers are already short &amp; this causes an uproar. Someone straight up erases his sidework, then writes it back in after realizing he wrote it (knowing he'll lose his mind)... Manager #1 still sees the changed handwriting &amp; straight up starts screaming at everyone about it. 

**Sunday**, only 8 servers but everyone is still short-tempered. Hostess says she'll come in at 4, doesn't show up, which leaves us short an SA who is now hosting. 

I keep getting double-sat &amp; also sat outside of my section for some reason, but it's alright at first. Then the food starts going out on 33-35 minute wait times. Great.

Now the re-cooks start coming in. I had a re-cook on almost every single table and 3 of them got sent back MULTIPLE times. Most tables were pissed off. One gentleman was finding it comical and tipped 25% because he felt bad for me. This is happening on all my tables PLUS every other server's tables. I couldn't get Manager #1 to talk to a table to save my life, so I'm trying to put out the fires alone. 

The only interaction I can get with Manager #1, actually, is for him to come back looking for one of my re-cooks. The person who brought it back apparently hadn't written a ticket for it. I did not know this - I had verified the kitchen had the steak and that they knew what temp &amp; table it was for. They did. Logical to assume they have the ticket. Nope. I still got screamed at by Manager #1. 

In the middle of re-cook hell, my camping 6-top flags me down to say ""We still haven't gotten our birthday cake"".  I just stared at the guy confused - had they brought in a cake that the host forgot to tell me about? I ask. Nope. They're expecting a free dessert. ""Um ok... well... I can do a scoop of ice cream with hot fudge?""  ""Well she's allergic to that, so don't you have a cake or anything we can have?""    Are you kidding me dude? It's Valentines weekend, you can SEE the chaos, and you're gonna sit here and demand special treatment? I straight up told him I didn't have the authority to give away anything beyond ice cream, and he gave a deep, sad sigh &amp; gave up. Gtfo out of here dude!

I've been working sick as fuck all weekend - still running my ass off &amp; being a 'team player'. I stop for 15 seconds to shovel a few bites of salad in my mouth &amp; Manager #2 barks at me ""Run some food!""  There was no fucking food to run. This manager is a 27 year old pot head and has been desperately clawing at getting some authority lately, since nobody respects him. For some reason, this was my last straw mentally. I'm a grown ass adult, I can deem when it's an appropriate time to take a 15 second break, fuck off!

Around 8pm, our best grill guy says ""Fuck you Managers, I'm tired of being yelled at"" and walks out. 

It's 9:10 pm, we close at 10. It's just walk-ins now, maybe a table every 10 minutes. Manager #1 still has FIVE servers on the floor. He's making cuts out of order. A long-time server gets into a screaming match with him about him not knowing how to do his job correctly. 3 of us end up staying until 10:30 because we were waiting on our single tables we got given after 9.

There's existing drama about favoritism - our entire management team is male - all the bartenders &amp; hourly managers are pretty females except for 1 flamboyant gay guy. The newest server (20 year old cutesy little girl who thinks she's better than she is) had never done anything but host before, and got promoted within a month, over a male SA of 2 years who is arguably way more qualified. 

In front of 4 of us rolling silverware, Manager #1 walks past with Cutesy New Server and loudly tells her ""Good job tonight, I'm buying you dinner... *you worked hard.""*   I thought the host sitting there was going to have an aneurysm - he came in early because of the no-show host &amp; didn't even get a thank you. It definitely felt like a fuck-you to the rest of us.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This is an admittedly stupid, stupid story, but it's something I have to deal with far too often.

I work for a well-known grocery store that uses a bell system. It's known for employing very nice people (who are genuinely kind), who rarely show frustration/attitude/anger because that's not who we are. We're all about providing a nice experience for our customers, and being as accommodating as possible.

Preface: I'm a gal who goes by my initials. My initials are my nickname. Have been going by this nickname for more than a decade; I'd say 95% of people I know call me it. My initials ARE my name. They ARE my identity. I feel most comfortable going by them. I feel safe going by them. The only people who call me by my birth name are immediate family and a VERY TINY group of friends, but even they'll call me by my initials often. ANYWAY. My initials are on my name tag at Bells Store. Customers frequently ask me about my name whenever I'm speaking with them, and I truly don't mind explaining the background of it, who gave it to me, etc. Usually, they drop the same joke I've heard a million times (there's a famous person who also goes by these initials) and move on in the conversation. It's all very succinct and almost always pleasant. But sometimes, I'll get customers who DEMAND I tell them my ""real"" name, and will not back down. This is a story about one of those times.

A couple of days ago, this guy comes to my register to pay. I don't think he was meaning to come off as an asshole, but was just...not aware of how he was sounding. He immediately zeros in on my name tag and jumps right in. I can't even get a GREETING out of my mouth before he starts.

I'm going to imagine this guy's first name was Richard. Because this is a story about nicknames, let's call him D for short.

D: [says my name]...What's your REAL name though?

Me: Oh haha this is my name! I've had it for almost 12 years, everyone calls me it, so...anyway, how's your day going?

D [deadpan]: So this is the name your parents gave you.

Me [As cheerfully as I can muster because I have a feeling I know where this is heading]: No sir! I guess it's really a nickname. But it's my preferred name, it's what I answer to. It's my initials, an--

D [interrupts, and starts to grin]: See now we're getting somewhere. Your initials. But what's your NAME.

Me [still a smile painted on my face, eyeing the enormous amount of items I still have to scan and bag and wishing some of them -- or even me -- could disappear]: Sir, the name on my tag IS my name. So did you do anything fun this weekend?

D [grin still on his face]: I find it hard to believe what's on your name tag is your actual name. Just tell me what it stands for.

Me [clearly getting uncomfortable]: Sir, the name on my tag are initials for my name. I have gone by my initials for a number of years [proceed to tell him who started calling me by my initials and why it stuck, but do not tell him what the letters stand for because...well honestly? it's nobody's business but my own. I don't owe a stranger any of my personal info. MY INITIALS ARE MY NAME.].

D, after dropping THAT DAMN BASIC JOKE mentioned above, then starts to try to guess my first name, and will just not. let. up. (""Is your name Lucy? Laura? Lindsey? C'mon, give me a hint! Am I warm?"") He also begins to say some socially inept things (""So you used to be an athlete, eh? Looks like you still eat like you're an athlete. Let me welcome you to the fat side."" ???). Finally, THANKFULLY, I'm done bagging his groceries, and he requests some help carrying them outside (a free service we offer). So I ring-a-ding that bell to call someone over for assistance, and who but my store's BOSS answers my call. The guy rarely does carry-outs. I feel like some angel is looking out for me. My boss is in the middle of greeting D, barely gets out ""How are--"" when D looks closely at my boss's name tag, and interrupts him to flatly say, ""Pronounce your name."" My boss was a little taken aback I think, but says his name (it's an uncommon ethnic name; my boss is a person of color). D then says to my boss, ""What's your middle name."" Boss, looking a bit confused, tells D his middle name. It's just awkward now. D tries to pronounce the names a couple of times -- names that honestly are not at all hard to pronounce -- LAUGHS, and gives up.

D, with that stupid grin on his face, then turns to me and goes, ""See, it's not that hard. He's got a first name and a middle name for days! HE should be the one with a nickname! Meanwhile, you're stonewalling. Well anyway, have a good one, *says my name SUPER sarcastically*""

I wish I knew what my face looked like in that moment.

My boss walks him out, and comes back about 10 minutes later, which I found weird because it shouldn't have taken him more than three minutes to get back. He immediately comes over to me and begins to apologize for D's behavior, and said a few things that made ME think my manager had some words with the guy. But my manager ends it with, ""Names are special to us, they hold significance. And I'm sorry that dude didn't understand that."" 

I guess this is what it comes down to: It's OK to ask questions about stuff. In fact I welcome all questions! Let's have a conversation! But like read the damn room. If you ask someone a question seven times in a row, and they are giving you an answer they deem sufficient, move on. You don't have to like my name, but you do have to respect it. I get it's unusual to YOU, but you don't know me. And you're not entitled to know anything about me, only info I'm willing to volunteer.

I have gone by my initials for a number of years [proceed to tell him who started calling me by my initials and why it stuck, but do not tell him what the letters stand for because...well honestly? it&amp;#39;s nobody&amp;#39;s business but my own. I don&amp;#39;t owe a stranger any of my personal info. MY INITIALS ARE MY NAME.].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D, after dropping THAT DAMN BASIC JOKE mentioned above, then starts to try to guess my first name, and will just not. let. up. (&amp;quot;Is your name Lucy? Laura? Lindsey? C&amp;#39;mon, give me a hint! Am I warm?&amp;quot;) He also begins to say some socially inept things (&amp;quot;So you used to be an athlete, eh? Looks like you still eat like you&amp;#39;re an athlete. Let me welcome you to the fat side.&amp;quot; ???). Finally, THANKFULLY, I&amp;#39;m done bagging his groceries, and he requests some help carrying them outside (a free service we offer). So I ring-a-ding that bell to call someone over for assistance, and who but my store&amp;#39;s BOSS answers my call. The guy rarely does carry-outs. I feel like some angel is looking out for me. My boss is in the middle of greeting D, barely gets out &amp;quot;How are--&amp;quot; when D looks closely at my boss&amp;#39;s name tag, and interrupts him to flatly say, &amp;quot;Pronounce your name.&amp;quot; My boss was a little taken aback I think, but says his name (it&amp;#39;s an uncommon ethnic name; my boss is a person of color). D then says to my boss, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your middle name.&amp;quot; Boss, looking a bit confused, tells D his middle name. It&amp;#39;s just awkward now. D tries to pronounce the names a couple of times -- names that honestly are not at all hard to pronounce -- LAUGHS, and gives up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D, with that stupid grin on his face, then turns to me and goes, &amp;quot;See, it&amp;#39;s not that hard. He&amp;#39;s got a first name and a middle name for days! HE should be the one with a nickname! Meanwhile, you&amp;#39;re stonewalling. Well anyway, have a good one, &lt;em&gt;says my name SUPER sarcastically&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew what my face looked like in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boss walks him out, and comes back about 10 minutes later, which I found weird because it shouldn&amp;#39;t have taken him more than three minutes to get back. He immediately comes over to me and begins to apologize for D&amp;#39;s behavior, and said a few things that made ME think my manager had some words with the guy. But my manager ends it with, &amp;quot;Names are special to us, they hold significance. And I&amp;#39;m sorry that dude didn&amp;#39;t understand that.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is what it comes down to: It&amp;#39;s OK to ask questions about stuff. In fact I welcome all questions! Let&amp;#39;s have a conversation! But like read the damn room. If you ask someone a question seven times in a row, and they are giving you an answer they deem sufficient, move on. You don&amp;#39;t have to like my name, but you do have to respect it. I get it&amp;#39;s unusual to YOU, but you don&amp;#39;t know me. And you&amp;#39;re not entitled to know anything about me, only info I&amp;#39;m willing to volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s my story!&lt;/p&gt;

I really just gotta vent, I don't know what to say at this point. The owner of the restaurant I work at (HUGELY popular seafood joint in the area, well known) did a live TV spot on the V-Day morning news, showcasing all our food and specials, drinks, even had a fucking Elvis impersonator join him and try all the foods, cakes, etc.

That's how it felt for us that night, except we've got trays full of 30oz margaritas and boiling hot soups right over these beautiful couples' heads. And of course nobody wants to fucking move when they're in your way, cuz fuck you. But whatever. Oh yeah, The King went ahead and played a live show in our bar that night, too. So yeah, nobody got out til about 2 hours past close **that night.**

I guess we all underestimated the power of doing a live TV spot in a densely populated area (who the fuck watches morning cable TV these days anyways?), Because Saturday was the exact same, just no Elvis.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Got a question for any servers in the DC area but in bigger cities in general. 

My wife and I are born and raised in Indiana. About a decade ago we took a trip out to DC to visit a friend who we went to school with and met her and some of her work friends at this little place for a beer and pizza happy hour (I can’t remember the place’s name). We ate and drank and our server dropped off the check. Our friend and her companions then threw all their cards in a pile and took out a pen. They wrote the last 4 digits of each their cards on the bill and the amount they owed and explained, “this is how we do it out here” when I asked why didn’t they just have the server split the check, so we went with it. 

Looking back on it this just seems like such a pain in the ass for the server. Even in Indiana back then we had POS systems that made splitting a check only a couple of button pushes. This wasn’t a written check it was printed. I’ve been in this industry for a while and never had anyone split a check this way with me but I don’t think I’d appreciate it, and it’d actually be more work for me. 

My question is do people really do that often in bigger cities? It seems dumb and overly obsequious.

We ate and drank and our server dropped off the check. Our friend and her companions then threw all their cards in a pile and took out a pen. They wrote the last 4 digits of each their cards on the bill and the amount they owed and explained, “this is how we do it out here” when I asked why didn’t they just have the server split the check, so we went with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it this just seems like such a pain in the ass for the server. Even in Indiana back then we had POS systems that made splitting a check only a couple of button pushes. This wasn’t a written check it was printed. I’ve been in this industry for a while and never had anyone split a check this way with me but I don’t think I’d appreciate it, and it’d actually be more work for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is do people really do that often in bigger cities? It seems dumb and overly obsequious. Like we don’t wanna disturb the great and powerful server at this not at all fancy bar and make her do a little bit of extra work that’s well within her job description.&lt;/p&gt;

I had a table today of 2 dads and their 2 sons around 8 years old. When they were ready to order the dads were trying to get the kids to tell me what they want but the kids didn’t really know what they wanted and their dads were snapping at them and trying to rush them along. I told them twice I could just come back if they’re not ready and they said no and told me to stay there. 

So I stood there for 5 minutes while they aggressively flipped through their children’s menus frantically pointing at shit and pushing their heads towards to menus telling them to look at them. One of them grabbed his sons straw from his hot chocolate and threw it at the kids head and he got whipped cream all in his hair. WTF.

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile guest no. 2 is trying to enjoy his steak. Tells me it is cooked to perfection, juicy and melts in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guest 1. Tells him that he doesn&amp;#39;t know what he is taking about. That no steak should have fat in it, and that he should send his steak back too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guest 2. Tries to defend his steak, literally tried to move it as far away from Guest 1 as he could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me was sad that Guest 1 was unhappy. Part of me was laughing my socks off at this comedy sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also happens when guests complain that the portions are too big. &amp;quot;No normal person could ever eat all of that!&amp;quot; While on the next table a little 80 year old lady has just polished off the same dish and now feels ashamed for being so greedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t try to shame other guests over their choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, can&amp;#39;t correct my title...&lt;/p&gt;

My girlfriend and I had recently moved to this area, she picked up a serving job at this decently nice restaurant and makes good cash from there. After a couple a months she said one of her managers who is also inline to become part owner of said restaurant.....was harassing her. My girlfriend is the type to not put up with that and basically told him off. But not in such a nice way, he is also smaller than her. Now she told me not to go down to the restaurant and say something to him. (Because trust me I would have...... or more because we need the money being we just moved and we need to save to get our careers started) So after this he isn’t as blunt as he is with the other servers to her because he is intimidated by her. He has been making her feel uncomfortable and been very mean to her because she turned down his advances. My girlfriend recently had a discussion with the other manager (female) who is also in line to be CO-Owner of the restaurant with the creepy manager. She told her about what was happening and how she felt uncomfortable. The female manager reassured her that “she would not allow this in my restaurant “ and that type of behavior is unacceptable”. She also told her that if that ever happens just to talk to her. She made my girlfriend feel a lot more safe and secure. A month later to where we are today the female manager has been very mean to my girlfriend for no reason. She shows up on time and stays late. Today she came home balling her eyes out because the manager had her do a bunch of side work from last night that the other severs left and it wasn’t her responsibility. She had told BOTH managers as soon as she started working she has another job which is her main job. They were perfectly fine working around her schedule. Today she told her that she had a meeting to go to at 3 and freaked out on her and said “THIS IS WHY WE CAN NEVER SCHEDULE YOU” my gf has told me she as been very mean and condescending towards just her ever since the talk. We have the impression that she doesn’t want my girlfriend there anymore and wants to either be mean or just fine the littlest thing for her to slip up because she is a threat to her future business.

Back story:

I work in a restaurant where the staff can get quiet huffy/short/mean when theres a rush and people are frustrated.
The BOH can get annoyed with mistakes (I'm prone to making mistakes). I've been working on getting better at triple checking my orders before sending, asking BOH about food sub requests etc. This is my second time being a server, I did 6 months this past summer at a country club.


However, theres usually a few bumps in the night that are entirely my fault and if it has to do with food thats been served I always let my patrons know it was me and not the kitchen that forgot an instruction. No point blaming anyone else when it's not their fault but mine.



I've gotten along quite well with most of the staff here. I try to be helpful, bus tables,run drinks, clean and reset etc. Sometimes I get too focused on my own stuff and helping others falls by the way side. I'd still consider my relations with my coworkers as friendly. I try my hardest to never be mean/snippy when I'm frustrated.


A cook in the back who also does shifts as a waitress here used to have a great relationship with me up until a month ago. She used to say hi when I came in and gave me a goofy nickname. Now she doesnt acknowledge me and anytime I speak or am in the kitchen she acts as if she is entirely exasperated with me and wants nothing to do with me. Took me a few weeks to stop thinking I was crazy/imagining her behavior or worse, excusing her nastiness by thinking ""shes frustrated bc its busy"". Nah, shes just been a downright bitch to me.

Example:

Last night, an order came up and I walked back to check that there wasnt anything ready to run for FOH. There was an app waiting for the Bar. I dont like to touch bar food because the tickets dont tell you who's order it is (ex. Bar 23646) and the bartending quarters are tight with saloon doors to enter. It's a perfect storm for me to bump into/drop things and fuck up the bartenders flow.


I saw the app waiting, read the ticket and said, ""oh this is for bar."" then set the ticket down.


My kitchen coworker then shot off in a nasty attitude about how I should take it out for bar because "" maybe Bartender's Name needs help and maybe not everything is about *you*.""



When I was done for the night I finally worked up the courage to say something to her before I left. However, because I can not do confrontation I immediately got choked up, teary eyed/red faced, paniced/anxiety riddled and unable to really speak. I tried explaining how shes been really rude to me for weeks. How Ive always thought she was a great person and dont understand why shes being so nasty. Also, that her words hurt my feelings and that I would never treat her in such a manner.



She tried defending herself and I asked her not to talk and just let me say what I needed to (because I was basically hysterical at this point and unable to get my words out). She interjected with comments like, ""of course, keep talking like you always do....its all about you. You make us look dumb back here.""

Eventually I went to leave and said, ""well, that was productive."" and she sarcastically agreed, as I left.
I want to note that my reaction to confrontation is what it is but hers is to have a smile the entire time which was even more unnerving.

So,

What do I do now, if anything? How do I act towards her? I cannot speak to her boss, because hes a massive prick who treats employees like complete garbage.

it's the middle of the winter in here,  the coatroom was full,  ppl were just grabbing their coats and leaving while the fire crew were coming in assessing the situation.

worst thing is,  while they did notice some very faint traces of gas, there was no reason to panic at all apparently,  it was probably just a normal security valve exhaust that got cought by the ventilation,  but i swear to god it smelled strongly enough of rotten eggs for about 20 minutes that even the guests were wondering what was going on.

over 2k in sales lost, including our tips...wait an hour in the cold while the fire and gas crew went over the whole thing.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hi, 

So I’m still reeling hours later and I wanted to share with you all.

Today during brunch I had this four top, a younger and older couple, come in and were immediately needy, wanted to know if juice or coffee was included in the prefix, etc. Yeehaw. Then older couple  demanded coffee immediately with milk and not cream, and two milks because one will never last between them. Okay. Run of to get that. Take their order. Fell behind and got a bit weeded but was working on catching up. 

I hadn’t been to their table in awhile and by the time I got back, the woman of the older couple had sent back her first course and was demanding extra dressing the replacement, saying “It’s been awhile since we’ve seen you.” And then the man was demanding “more coffee this time, and make sure it’s hot this time. “ 

Second course, the woman is still eating her salad when it comes, so the runner takes it back. It gets cold on the line by the time it’s back in front of it. I refire it. The man waves me over. He’s upset because his meal came out with home fries and not fingerling potatoes. I explain that normally comes out with home fries, even though, I’m sorry, the menu says fingerlings  (I really was, my restaurant is not the best at communication and it switches stuff up all the time). 

He demand that I go get him fingerling potatoes. I ask the chef. He says we can’t. I explain to the man and he’s furious. He tells me “that if wanted home fries, he’d just go get them from the local diner. Fingerling potatoes are something you get when you go out and not when you cook at home.” I said I was sorry, I tried, and ran off to get drinks for my other tables and promptly burst into tears as soon i was at the service bar.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Full disclosure this is a combination Tales from your server/ tales from the customer.   


I have had quite a night. First off I work in an Arena as a server (more or less). In 3 hours I had about $1600 in sales. Which I think might be a personal best. Sadly tips didn't keep pace. Most of my cash tabs fucked me hard to the tune of around 10% overall with only one person giving me a decent tip from my perspective. (credit tips/tabs were alright though) Also Mr. $5 on a $116 tab, fuck you very much. However I still walked away with like $211.50 in tips in fours hours so I really shouldn't complain because honestly I'm pretty lucky at my job. 

&amp;#x200B;

But wait, there's more!

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards we all go out to our local watering hole after work because we are having a farewell party for one of our coworkers who is quitting to become a flight attendant. (Good luck buddy. I still think you are too tall for that but fair skies and whatnot) For hours we eat drink and be merry (yay!) The night is finally winding down however and the man of the hour has had a bit too much. I am trying to move him out the door because we've all seen that guest who needs to go and at this moment it's my guy. (Much love though Bro) However since he has had a few too many he decides to approach two women who were not part of our party and try his luck. He did touch one of them not a grope or anything but still an unsolicited touch. At this point on of the bar employees tries to through him out but he doesn't want to go. Now I was still kinda of drunk at this point so I can't swear to a perfect recollection of what happened next but the employee start throwing hands (punches for those not in the know). I think they employee swung first but again I wasn't totally sober at this point so I won't swear to it.  I get between them lower my friends arms and stop the fight. The employee tells me to;   


""Get out of the way"" So he can keep trying to punch my friend.  


""No."" Like I'll get him out of the bar but dude you have to stop.

My buddy naturally upset by this tried to refuse to leave the bar, wanted a hug from the bartender. (Who was a sweetie but come on dude.) and kept repeating the phrase; 

""So this is how I leave?""

But still I got him out walked him to the train station where he promised I'd be alright. Though I will admit to not actually putting him on the train. At that point I got some water got the other guy's best work friend out of the bar walked him to his train Station. Walked back a second time and got more water. Insta hangover plus talking makes me a thirsty guy and got my last coworker and her niece to their train station before I went home myself. All in all quite the night but at least I can take breaking up a bar fight off my bucket list. Hope that doesn't happen again any time soon.

However I still walked away with like $211.50 in tips in fours hours so I really shouldn&amp;#39;t complain because honestly I&amp;#39;m pretty lucky at my job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, there&amp;#39;s more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we all go out to our local watering hole after work because we are having a farewell party for one of our coworkers who is quitting to become a flight attendant. (Good luck buddy. I still think you are too tall for that but fair skies and whatnot) For hours we eat drink and be merry (yay!) The night is finally winding down however and the man of the hour has had a bit too much. I am trying to move him out the door because we&amp;#39;ve all seen that guest who needs to go and at this moment it&amp;#39;s my guy. (Much love though Bro) However since he has had a few too many he decides to approach two women who were not part of our party and try his luck. He did touch one of them not a grope or anything but still an unsolicited touch. At this point on of the bar employees tries to through him out but he doesn&amp;#39;t want to go. Now I was still kinda of drunk at this point so I can&amp;#39;t swear to a perfect recollection of what happened next but the employee start throwing hands (punches for those not in the know). I think they employee swung first but again I wasn&amp;#39;t totally sober at this point so I won&amp;#39;t swear to it.  I get between them lower my friends arms and stop the fight. The employee tells me to;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get out of the way&amp;quot; So he can keep trying to punch my friend.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; Like I&amp;#39;ll get him out of the bar but dude you have to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My buddy naturally upset by this tried to refuse to leave the bar, wanted a hug from the bartender. (Who was a sweetie but come on dude.) and kept repeating the phrase; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So this is how I leave?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still I got him out walked him to the train station where he promised I&amp;#39;d be alright. Though I will admit to not actually putting him on the train. At that point I got some water got the other guy&amp;#39;s best work friend out of the bar walked him to his train Station. Walked back a second time and got more water. Insta hangover plus talking makes me a thirsty guy and got my last coworker and her niece to their train station before I went home myself. All in all quite the night but at least I can take breaking up a bar fight off my bucket list. Hope that doesn&amp;#39;t happen again any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS Thought the employee was a barback, turns out he was the manager. YEESH!&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Medium sized Midwestern town. Three Mexican restaurants. One of them (fake name is El Glotón) is currently closed as they are renovating. All their customers, rather than simply forgoing Mexican food for a while, are inflicting us with their presence at the restaurant I work at. Fake name is Sabroso. We absolutely would love to treat new customers to a great experience and great food, but these folks are so pissed about not getting to eat at El Glotón they take it out on their server and/or the owners. 


Family of five last night. Older Woman, Older Man, Younger Woman, Younger Man, and a toddler. They are sour faced, don’t smile back, no eye contact. Despite having a minute with our menu, have no idea what drink options we have. That’s okay, I tell them what we have. Get them settled in with drinks and a large queso. I’m trying hard to give them fast service on a packed night. My heart sinks when the man asks if we have something similar to the “Super Burrito”, the name for a burrito at El Glotón. I try to give him options that will satisfy the craving. The other three without talking to me, talking to table, they ask for “Chicken Nachos”. 


This could be an app nacho with just grilled chicken, our supreme nachos (shredded chicken, queso, shredded cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and tomatoes) or our chicken fajita nachos (same as supreme but with grilled chicken instead of shredded and added grilled veg). I finally wrestle out of them what they want, which is three orders of Chicken Supreme Nachos. Note the lack of veg, which I exhaustively went over with them. Describing food takes considerably longer especially when talking about the differences between items. It’s okay though, I’ll spoon feed you your entire dining experience if it means you’ll leave happy.


Food comes out, I’m keeping drinks and chips full, check after the first couple of bites. “How is everything?” I ask.


“Fine.” One mumbled response from the Younger Man. Okay. Cool. I’ll leave them alone now. They clean their plates, I drop the check, wish them well, no response. Also fine. They didn’t talk throughout the meal. They just seem miserable but I’m not their therapist, I asked them how things were and they gave me no indication of how I could improve their experience other than magically turning Sabroso into El Glotón.


The Younger Woman goes up to pay. One of the owners is at the register. The owner, Esme, asks her how everything was.


Younger Woman: It’ll do.

Esme: (offended) Oh? Was something wrong with your food?

YW: Well, it’s no El Glotón.

Esme: (very offended) You’re right, it’s better. 


Mic drop! I love our owners. They are two  older women who take very little bullshit.

YW fires back: We didn’t even get any grilled vegetables in our chicken nachos.

Esme: All you had to do was ask.

YW: At El Glotón we don’t HAVE to ask. And we don’t have to pay extra for it.

Esme: Yes, well, I’m glad you like El Glotón so much. I hope they reopen for you soon. 


The Younger Woman has paid at this point, huffs and leaves. I was sitting off to the side in shock at what I was hearing. Esme looks at me and asks me if they gave me any problems, to which I said no but that they were generally determined to be miserable. No tip, of course. 


I’ll be SO glad when the other restaurant reopens so we can stop being plagued by their terrible customers.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So Thursday I was working a relatively slow shift. Maybe four people at at 24 seat bar and a couple with a kid across the room at a high top.

Not a lot of action going on, so I had plenty of time to gab with my guests and my table. I don't really get into deep conversation with my tables, they don't want to sit there the whole time and chat with me and I need to make sure I'm behind the bar most of the time cleaning or taking care of my guests.

Well the lady at my table seemed to have taken a shine to me because I recommended an IPA she liked and went on about how we should be friends on Facebook, to which I told her very truthfully that I don't have one anymore and don't intend on using it, and she decided her, the older-ish gentlemen, and her daughter would now sit at the bar.

I should probably mention they were both drinking 22oz beers, because we have those on special that day.

So now they're at the bar they start eavesdropping on my conversation with these two very lovely young women about my age. One of them said something about having a bad memory and I off-handedly joked ""Ah, sounds like you smoke the reefer if you don't have good short term memory.""

Well this interested my strange new ""friend"", and she starts asking me if I know anyone that can get her any and she suffers from all these terrible things that cannabis could help with.

Wanting to appear friendly but keep my work and personal lives separate, I scribbled down the number of a pizzeria in Charlotte I used to frequent and told her to text that number later tonight. That's that, or so I thought.

She then gets really weird and asks if I want to be her friend. I try to explain I keep work and my personal life separate and I don't hangout with my guests ever, but she just won't have it. She starts asking if I wanna go smoke with ""us"" in their kids treehouse.

Keep in mind, all of this is taking place in front of their child and the dude. While I'm just standing there, trying to step around what I finally realized (I'm a late bloomer and not used to attention from women) this chick is trying to get me to fuck her with this dude who apparently isn't married to her, as she moved from the town over to hide from her crazy ex-husband.

I'm at a complete loss for words. I'm getting off the clock in fifteen minutes and this chick is about ready to drag me into her car, because she's getting obsessed with me.

I swap places with the upstairs bartender for the last 15 and apparently she asked non-stop about when I'm getting off and where I went.

Soon as the clock hit 5 I grabbed my jacket, ducked out of the backdoor into the alley, and went home to unwind.

As I'm sitting at my coffee table, rolling myself a nice smoke, I look at the work group chat and see everyone at work talking about this chick. She was there for thirty minutes after I left, asking about me, flirting with my other co-workers, and making out with that older dude while the child just stood under them watching.

Then I get a text from my AGM asking what kind of spell I put on this crazy lady, promising to let me know when they were leaving since I was going out for a few drinks and wanted to stop back in at some point.

As I'm pulling up to the intersection on the street my bar is at I see the dude trying to corral this very sexually aggressive and angry chick while keeping an eye on the child.

Not wanting to draw attention to myself, I ducked down in the seat and waiter for them to pass while the light changed then proceeded to drink many beers.

TL;DR: Crazy lady wants me to bang her and some dude in their kids treehouse.

So, on Valentine's day dinner, my restuarant lost power around 7:30. It became a disaster shortly after.

With the power out, the vents couldn't get the smoke out of the kitchen, so it started to go from the BOH to FOH. And to the point it sat off our fire alarms.

Meanwhile, tables didn't really care despite sitting in the dark. Someone complained it was foggy. Someone complained it was cold. Someone complained that the alarms were too loud.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’m a hostess and tonight our guest management system completely shut down in the middle of our rush. This left us to switch over to doing our wait list old school and I’m the only host who knows how to do that. My managers don’t even know how to do it. We had 45 small tops on the waitlist and guests were already waiting at least 15 minutes past their quote times and I understand them being upset, but there’s only so much I can do as the old system isn’t as efficient.
As I’m finally starting to find a groove with my host team, I have the same 3 or 4 guests come up and ask about their wait and I told them all the same thing “I’m so sorry about the wait. Our system just shut down and I’m working on getting everyone seated as fast as I can.” Mind you, there was still not an empty table in the restaurant during this time. Despite the system shutting down, I was still getting guests seated at every possible open table and putting tables together for my big tops.

Anyway I have an extra table now and I’m being quadruple sat. Dope. What even is being weeded. 


I go and greet this table of four, couple in their early/mid thirties and the guys parents. They’re all lovely, they order their drinks and off I go back into the weeds. When I go to deliver said drinks, I somehow manage to spill a drink off my tray while putting another drink down and it fell onto the table, causing the candle to tip over and spill wax across the middle of the table. So now there’s not only a drink with pebble ice all over the table, there’s also wax. I swear it happened in slow mo in my head I felt so terrible and I apologized profusely, they were so sweet, they didn't even flinch when I spilled and were totally cool about everything. I made some self deprecating jokes about it (while actually dying of embarrassment inside) The guy who's drink it was even took a sip of the rest of the drink that was in the glass and made a joke about it being a taste like I had poured for the father who ordered a glass of wine.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Here’s what we get to deal with at my job: people coming into the kitchen. Even though we don’t have a sign (as I said, we oddly need one now), it should be clear that a kitchen is meant for just employees. 

ADULT customers will often pop their head into the back to ask for more ranch. Ya know, instead of waiting for a server to pass by. Because they need that ranch NOW. They didn’t need it when the server asked two minutes ago if they needed anything else. But this is mild. Adults sometimes also like to enter through the walkway of the bar and the open kitchen to try and pay their server.

i havent been making serious mistakes, nor have i been late to work. im not sure if its just me but my coworker who is filipino is always working 4 days a week and 10-11 hours per day as well, no change. my assumption might be that because my manager is filipino as well, so im not sure if she's being biased towards my coworker because she likes her more so she schedules her more hours.

im also confused as to why they wouldnt want to schedule me for more hours, im a cheaper employee to schedule considering the fact that my other coworkers earn a little more than me because they have prior experience. however, this doesnt mean that i dont perform as well because of my lack of experience, i make sure to do my job well every single day because i really enjoy doing it.

or it might also be due to the recent wuhan coronavirus so they're cutting employee hours (just me unfortunately). im okay with not earning the money from my hours but im not okay knowing that my schedule has been slashed without a proper notice or reason. could anyone comfort me or maybe tell me the possible reason why?",t2_45bwo60v,False,,0,False,a little worry i have?,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_f4sb39,False,dark,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medium,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1581896603.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi guys, so im 17 and have been working part time for this restaurant for almost 3 months now. usually, i would work 3 days per week, usually for about 10-11 hours per day. however, recently my manager has been scheduling me for only 2 days a week and slashing my hours completely in half. im worried-have i been underperforming?&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So last night (Saturday) was uncharacteristically disorganised. This was due to a combination of kitchen staff being late, and two of our primary floor staff being rostered off. This situation meant that for almost half of service, we were running on reduced staff in both front and back of house. 

This already stressful situation was not made better by the presence of a 12-top of which half were children under 5. Not only did this table have kids interfering with our pathways, they also had a DELIGHTFUL man who satisfies every stereotypical definition of an unreasonable customer. This man hit all the checks - extreme overexaggeration of wait times (claimed an hour wait for food when it was no more than 30 minutes - normal for a busy Saturday), rudely addressing the floor staff (particularly women), and arguing with staff over what food we serve.

Now, for reference, our restaurant serves tacos of two different shells - soft wheat or hard corn. We do NOT sell soft corn or hard wheat, a point which is made clear by our menus and our staff. This man refused to accept that this was true, claiming our menus suggested otherwise. Rather than calmly accepting that his tacos couldn't be made with soft corn, he instead climbed atop his high horse in efforts to assert dominance - obviously he, a customer who doesn't work in the restaurant, knows our menu better than experienced staff. 

After having to deal with this man, I immediately informed the boss that a complaint may be headed his way in due time. The boss stops by the table to mitigate any complaints, and we go about service. But then something I have not ever had the pleasure of witnessing before happened - the other people at the table actively took our side. Probably only 15 minutes after the boss had dealt with the table, he told me that one of the women came up to him and said

I'm a barista, and I had a group order just takeaway coffees during a rush today. After they placed their order, one of the women got me and my coworker's attention to rudely tell us we ""needed to actually water these plants"". (We water all of the cafe's plants every single day)

At this point I couldn't really say much because I was very busy and she had walked away quickly to water the rest of our ""dehydrated"" plants throughout the cafe.

,TalesFromYourServer,"A small group of middle aged men came in together last night. Right away they were all telling me how beautiful I am which I thought was really unnecessary because since when is it considered normal to bombard a random person with compliments? I get complimenting someone on something specific if you genuinely like their hair or something but idk I just feel like that’s weird to acknowledge a random strangers entire overall appearance??? Am I crazy?? Because they’re middle aged men and I’m a young woman it obviously just comes off kinda weird and I don’t know how they could be unaware of that. 

It was Valentine’s Day right so they also went on and on about how I should be out being pampered??? They asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said no so they asked me if any guys bought me flowers and I said no and they got all loud acting surprised. I think shit like this just triggers me extra hard because I hate being judged for my appearance even if it’s in a “positive” way.

So one guy pays for it all and the bill was only $92 because they didn’t get much and he hands me $8 and says “this is your tip” then hands me $100 and asks for his change. I normally might think that was a bad joke but I didn’t have much faith in him as a person at this point so I literally just handed him back the $8 he had just handed me and he took it.

Am I crazy?? Because they’re middle aged men and I’m a young woman it obviously just comes off kinda weird and I don’t know how they could be unaware of that. &lt;/p&gt;

A ticket comes out for 4 steaks: 2 medium sirloins, a medium-well fillet, and a rare ribeye. I run out the mediums the medium-well, drop them off, and come right back with the rare. I ask them to check their steaks, cut into them to make sure they're cooked right, and if they need anything before I head back.

,TalesFromYourServer,"A lady who was carrying her baby slipped on our floor last night. Lady landed on her ass and baby landed on its head. Baby wailed for about fifteen minutes, which I totally get. I didn't get all the details, but I think it was just a freak accident as opposed to a slippery floor. Asisstant manager (AM) took care of both of them and I think the situation was resolved.

Half an hour or so later, I overhear a convo with AM and two gentleman, a middle-aged and older guy. They're really upset about the baby's wailing. I assumed it was the lady's father and husband, or husband and FiL, father and brother - some variation of that.

Turns out they were random diners who were furious about having their dinner interrupted by the wailing baby and wanted the whole thing comped and vouchers for them to come back and enjoy their dinner in peace, but only if we could guarantee there would be no wailing children.

Like... I get how annoying it was to listen to a distressed baby for fifteen minutes. Objectively, it was deeply unpleasant, and if it had been, say, an irritable child having a tantrum, I would have gotten other diners being peeved that the parents didn't take them someone to calm down. But a baby was dropped on its head through a freak accident. Show some compassion.

Update: So AM couldn't get a name, number or any contact details out of the mum, who just wanted to take her kids and go home. Early this afternoon (the day after the incident) and 'older' woman, who AM thought was maybe her mum, called to ask what was being done. AM said she had no name or contact details and no-one had called the venue to fill them in. She asked the older woman for a means of contacting her, and the woman hung up. AM then scoured our bookings and walk-ins for last night and couldn't find a booking that matched their description (in terms of numbers) but we had a walk-in that could be them (right time and number of people). But they refused to give a credit card, which is our policy when sitting outside, so paid for everything as they went by coming up to the bar, instead of having table service. So we were given no name or means of contacting them, no booking that we could refer to, not even a name of a credit card that we could look up in the white pages.",t2_21074r9g,False,,0,False,Lady slips and her baby lands on its head; random diners complain about the wailing,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_f42i98,False,dark,,public,75,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medium,False,75,,False,self,1581772788.0,,[],{},,True,,1581759751.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lady who was carrying her baby slipped on our floor last night. Lady landed on her ass and baby landed on its head. Baby wailed for about fifteen minutes, which I totally get. I didn&amp;#39;t get all the details, but I think it was just a freak accident as opposed to a slippery floor. Asisstant manager (AM) took care of both of them and I think the situation was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half an hour or so later, I overhear a convo with AM and two gentleman, a middle-aged and older guy. They&amp;#39;re really upset about the baby&amp;#39;s wailing. I assumed it was the lady&amp;#39;s father and husband, or husband and FiL, father and brother - some variation of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out they were random diners who were furious about having their dinner interrupted by the wailing baby and wanted the whole thing comped and vouchers for them to come back and enjoy their dinner in peace, but only if we could guarantee there would be no wailing children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like... I get how annoying it was to listen to a distressed baby for fifteen minutes. Objectively, it was deeply unpleasant, and if it had been, say, an irritable child having a tantrum, I would have gotten other diners being peeved that the parents didn&amp;#39;t take them someone to calm down. But a baby was dropped on its head through a freak accident. Show some compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

So, I work at a very popular seafood restaurant that becomes ridiculously busy on Valentine’s Day. Our restaurant is quite small compared to the other restaurants in the chain, therefore things are smushed. There’s no waiting area, people are literally crowding the entire front of the restaurant and bar so you can’t even go up there. 

Anyways, my coworker walks out of our kitchen and right in front of her is one of her tables, and the lady is on one knee, proposing to her boyfriend, right in front of the door. She continues to give him a speech for 2 ish minutes until my coworker has to tell her she needs to move because everyone is carrying heavy trays right out that door and won’t see her. 

The lady proceeded to cry, and claim that my coworker ruined her proposal. My coworker went back to check on them, since it was her table, and the lady was still crying. My coworker then cried in the kitchen because she felt bad, then felt even worse when they requested a new server.

Through most of the rush I’m just getting clowned, 5-6 tables, other guy had 8, not having a good time at the moment. 

Unimportant to my story though, I’m gonna talk about these two, very nice looking old women sit down in the cafe. It’s been busy, I’ve been stressing. I wasn’t interested in taking them, someone asked me if I was going to, because they weren’t, someone else who had just decided to take a couple tables in the cafe asked me if I wanted to, because they weren’t. So I did. They had wine so I made a joke about how they were clearly doing fine on drinks and if they were interested in ordering any food or getting anything else and they said, “No I think we’re just gonna talk.” Okay.

&lt;p&gt;2 hours pass, the waits been over, a couple parties have come in but nothing serious. I have one table left and I’ve been cut, I’m ready to leave, between slight breathing problems because of asthma, having been sick the past couple days, and just tired in general I was done. Those two ladies are still there though, and they are not done. I got told by someone that they asked for me, because they were ready. So I go out there, see what’s up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the table, “Hey we’re ready to order, we’d both like the soup &amp;amp; salad.” Okay, awesome, do you really mean to tell me I waited 2 hours just to get 2 dollars from you guys? Not only that, but you honestly didn’t even want me around. Have the fucking balls to look me in the eyes when I’m bringing you 5 dollars worth of a home meal and “waters along with that please.” Yes ma’am, as long as alright after you leave me that 2 dollars thats the last thing you’ll need from me.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Howdy, folks.  This is my first post as I generally do not air my dirty laundry.  However, this is a post about an incident that has never happened before.  This is the first time I have ever been treated as, basically, human trash.

I work a full time tech job and as a part time cook/server at a billiards hall (cook/server because I also run my orders). This establishment hosts leagues and tournaments almost every night of the week.  There are also two very large tournaments every year - mid-February and Labor Day weekend.  These two tournaments bring players from all over.  Some are world champions.  Both tournaments run from Wednesday to Monday.  Last night was opening night of the 10 Ball tournament.  Wednesday is more of a practice day with only a Ring Game (I think that's the term) as part of the tournament.  I shoot pool, but only for fun.

Cast:

Me - Me

CB - Cheeseburger guy (tournament player from parts unknown)

DW - Dickweed (tournament player from parts unknown)

RL - Regular and league player (not in the tournament)

OW - Owner Wife

I could tell CB and DW know each other.

On to the meat of the story...

I ran a cheeseburger and fries to the floor and handed it to CB.  As I was handing CB his food, DW sticks his hand in the basket to ""steal"" a couple of fries and makes his way past me while I'm still holding the basket to ensure CB didn't drop it due to the abrupt way DW took the fries.  DW walks between two pool tables and I start to make my way behind him.  I go behind him as there is a group of four people blocking one direction and a person lining up a shot in another.  It just so happens the direction we were going would have been clear for me to make it past the next row of tables without interfering with anybody's play.  Well, DW stops, turns around and says, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.""  I look at him thinking maybe he is going to hand me a tip.  Not so lucky.  This bag of syphilitic dicks wipes the hand he used for the fries front and back across my chest and turns to line up a shot.  I should point out that I am male and had an apron on, but that's beside the point.  

Folks, it was all I could do to just walk away shaking my head.  RL follows me to the kitchen to compliment me on my restraint.  RL wanted to hit him with this cane.  I have been in service and retail long enough to know to not pop off on customers.  Besides, I had to get back to the kitchen.

After finishing the next order, I communicated to our servers, barback and bartender/MOD who the guy is, what he did and that it was his mulligan.  They all agreed they would report any future mistreatment towards them and most likely have him booted.

Well, folks, the guy left before I calmed down or had the time between orders to talk to him.  The owners showed back up a little later.  I had a converstion with them about the incident.  To say it softly, OW does not abide this type of treatment.  She has a description and we will be seeking him out today to deliver the news.

Even after this experience, I hope he does it again.

“Tips paid by credit cards are subject to a 2.6% deduction to cover the tip related part of the credit card fees; *company name* pays remainder of the fees. The 2.6% is made prior to the distribution of tips.” 

What is the reminder of the fees? They don’t mention that. Is this legal? This part of the afternoon was weird af, the fact that all new hires couldn’t really ask questions, seemed like sign now, ask questions later. 

Also, have you ever heard of wage credits? The “Tip Agreement” form also mentioned:

“We will be taking a tip credit of .75 against our minimum wage obligation but the tip credit taken cannot be greater than the tips you actually receive. You will be paid a direct wage of $.$$” 

I feel like a big idiot for not understanding this, I’ve been a server for a while and never heard or worked for a company that did this - having  servers pay CC fees or a tip credit, though I do understand how the tip system works in a restaurant. I told the HR person I had never heard of this and she said it happened in “all 50 states” but I previously worked in a different state and were never notified about this. I have also worked in this state before and never heard of it. This a corporate restaurant and something just doesn’t sit right to me for some reason, if someone can explain this to me in laymen’s terms I’d appreciate it very much.

The poor guy sitting next to me on the train on my commute home must think I’m a lunatic typing furiously nonstop for the last hour.\n\nSo I work in a coffeeshop. Most of our customers are genuinely lovely people but over the years I have learned about the levels of entitlement and just plain crazy that exist. To be honest, I didn’t think anyone could surprise me anymore. Tonight’s events might actually have surpassed the guy who put a curse on me and my family, the guy who threw a ceramic cup at my head one morning, the drunk girls who threw up all over the front door at 7am then walked in and got grumpy that we didn’t have any vegan breakfast items, the time a guy managed to get himself so wound up that he started swearing at me because I hadn’t laughed hard enough at his “if you can’t find the product on the till then it’s free” joke that I had obviously never ever heard before. Ever. Honest. \n\nAnyway, so today I was cleaning up like usual and for once it was going pretty smoothly. One of those dream shifts where you look around and just know you’re going to get out on time. No last minute customers demanding you make drinks that mess up every piece of equipment you’ve just spent an hour cleaning. It. Was. Glorious. Then it happened. I did the usual rounds telling the last few stragglers that we were closing in 5 minutes so if they could start finishing up and getting themselves ready etc. and I went through to the office to start the admin. Now one thing you need to know is our company policy states that you can’t take the till off and count it until the doors are locked. Obviously you can’t lock the doors until all the customers have left. This is usually not a problem. \n\nSo I came back through to lock the doors and there she is. Let’s call her Karen. Karen is standing near the front door and emptying out the entire contents of her purse and pram all over a table. I looked at the girl who I was working with and raised an eyebrow. She’s worked with me long enough to recognise the WTF is going on look. Apparently Karen had lost an Airpod. Great. So since she’s a regular customer of over a year I put on my best customer service act and go across. We go back and check where I knew she’d been sitting. Then check out the other table she had also been sitting at earlier. Turns out I never want to put my bare hands that far down the sides of the sofas again. We both searched and couldn’t see anything. I offered for her to leave her details incase it turned up in the morning. I’m on the open so I’d have another look tomorrow. But nope. This wasn’t good enough.\n\nBefore my eyes this usually very normal, polite, pretty reserved grown ass woman turned into a raging banshee. Screeching about how they’re £150 Airpods. Several things happened over the next half hour. Her husband appeared. Someone needs to give that man a medal, or maybe a CT scan. He quickly sussed out the situation and tried to talk some sense into her. She then started screaming about how she wasn’t leaving until it was found and she was calling the police. At one point they were physically fighting over her phone while she dialled 999 and he was calling her crazy. Sidenote: never call a Karen “crazy”. It does not end well my friend. I was standing to the side quietly watching this all unfold, keys in one hand and phone in the other, while texting my boss what was going on and reminding her she really does not pay me enough to deal with this stuff. Being the absolute champion boss she is she called and heard some of the chaos going on in the background. Karen’s poor husband continued to try and reason with her. There was a little more chat between me and him while she wailed down the phone at the police. She started demanding I go check the rubbish bags. Apparently telling her she was more than welcome to go check them herself but they were in the skip sized bins at the back of the building was not the right answer. Eventually her extremely patient husband got sick of her so left. At one point she shouted at my colleague who asked her to move so she could finish mopping the floor which set Karen off again. Her husband reappeared as she was kicking off at me again for stepping in and saying the girl didn’t shout at her and pointing out that after her behaviour for the past 20 minutes she was in no position to decide who is and is not shouting. It was at this point she finally pushed the limit of my patience when she said the words “I’m not leaving until you show me respect. You would treat me differently if i was from this country”. \n\nNow, something else you should know. I’m not actually from this country either. I might have the local accent but my birth certificate states something different. I’m also not white. So I take particular offence when someone tries to use the race card in a situation that is clearly not even close to being racist. Sometimes people are just jackasses and it has nothing to do with the skin colour of anyone involved. So my restrained customer persona slipped. I laughed one of those “are you kidding me” laughs and said the words “Did you actually just call me racist? Nope. I’m out.” while her husband started having a go at her for being ridiculous. I went and grabbed the till and stormed off into the office half expecting to come back out and find Karen chaining herself to the front door and chanting “we shall not be moved”. \n\nAbout 10mins later 2 wonderful police officers showed up. Karen had suddenly turned into a timid and demure delicate little victim again while whining about her plight to these guys. They also quickly worked out what was going on. Apparently the call they’d got had said it was a domestic incident. It was clearly not a domestic incident. They spent 5mins searching the same areas and also found no Airpod in sight and suggested she leave her contact details for us to call her if it turned up in the morning. Karen thought this was a great idea. I pointed to the counter and said the pen and paper were still sitting there from when we offered that same thing an hour before. Granted it was a childish move. But after hearing the police officers asking where her child was while she played with the Airpods my last sliver of understanding and patience evaporated. Turns out Karen had freely given her very expensive (arguably overpriced) headphones to her 4 year old child to play with then flipped out and called the police when one went missing. Seriously. I can’t even begin to explain how livid I was at this point. Needless to say, she is now barred from the premises by orders of my boss. Best. Boss.

The poor guy sitting next to me on the train on my commute home must think I’m a lunatic typing furiously nonstop for the last hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I work in a coffeeshop. Most of our customers are genuinely lovely people but over the years I have learned about the levels of entitlement and just plain crazy that exist. To be honest, I didn’t think anyone could surprise me anymore. Tonight’s events might actually have surpassed the guy who put a curse on me and my family, the guy who threw a ceramic cup at my head one morning, the drunk girls who threw up all over the front door at 7am then walked in and got grumpy that we didn’t have any vegan breakfast items, the time a guy managed to get himself so wound up that he started swearing at me because I hadn’t laughed hard enough at his “if you can’t find the product on the till then it’s free” joke that I had obviously never ever heard before. Ever. Honest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so today I was cleaning up like usual and for once it was going pretty smoothly. One of those dream shifts where you look around and just know you’re going to get out on time. No last minute customers demanding you make drinks that mess up every piece of equipment you’ve just spent an hour cleaning. It. Was. Glorious. Then it happened. I did the usual rounds telling the last few stragglers that we were closing in 5 minutes so if they could start finishing up and getting themselves ready etc. and I went through to the office to start the admin. Now one thing you need to know is our company policy states that you can’t take the till off and count it until the doors are locked. Obviously you can’t lock the doors until all the customers have left. This is usually not a problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I came back through to lock the doors and there she is. Let’s call her Karen. Karen is standing near the front door and emptying out the entire contents of her purse and pram all over a table. I looked at the girl who I was working with and raised an eyebrow. She’s worked with me long enough to recognise the WTF is going on look. Apparently Karen had lost an Airpod. Great. So since she’s a regular customer of over a year I put on my best customer service act and go across. We go back and check where I knew she’d been sitting. Then check out the other table she had also been sitting at earlier. Turns out I never want to put my bare hands that far down the sides of the sofas again. We both searched and couldn’t see anything. I offered for her to leave her details incase it turned up in the morning. I’m on the open so I’d have another look tomorrow. But nope. This wasn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before my eyes this usually very normal, polite, pretty reserved grown ass woman turned into a raging banshee. Screeching about how they’re £150 Airpods. Several things happened over the next half hour. Her husband appeared. Someone needs to give that man a medal, or maybe a CT scan. He quickly sussed out the situation and tried to talk some sense into her. She then started screaming about how she wasn’t leaving until it was found and she was calling the police. At one point they were physically fighting over her phone while she dialled 999 and he was calling her crazy. Sidenote: never call a Karen “crazy”. It does not end well my friend. I was standing to the side quietly watching this all unfold, keys in one hand and phone in the other, while texting my boss what was going on and reminding her she really does not pay me enough to deal with this stuff. Being the absolute champion boss she is she called and heard some of the chaos going on in the background. Karen’s poor husband continued to try and reason with her. There was a little more chat between me and him while she wailed down the phone at the police. She started demanding I go check the rubbish bags. Apparently telling her she was more than welcome to go check them herself but they were in the skip sized bins at the back of the building was not the right answer. Eventually her extremely patient husband got sick of her so left. At one point she shouted at my colleague who asked her to move so she could finish mopping the floor which set Karen off again. Her husband reappeared as she was kicking off at me again for stepping in and saying the girl didn’t shout at her and pointing out that after her behaviour for the past 20 minutes she was in no position to decide who is and is not shouting. It was at this point she finally pushed the limit of my patience when she said the words “I’m not leaving until you show me respect. You would treat me differently if i was from this country”. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, something else you should know. I’m not actually from this country either. I might have the local accent but my birth certificate states something different. I’m also not white. So I take particular offence when someone tries to use the race card in a situation that is clearly not even close to being racist.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Here’s a doozy for you all:

About 2-3 weeks ago I was on the bar by myself during a busy Friday. My bar was full, but a man (let’s call him Asshat)/semi-regular came in and stood behind a couple he knew at the bar. He asked me for a glass of Monkey 47 gin, neat. I only had enough for a half pour, which I told him when I gave it to him. Still $6.50 for a half pour. So I rang it in and go about my business. 

A little while later, looking through my tabs I see his, and go to look for him - he’s gone. So I grabbed my assistant manager who was food running that night to see if he had seen Asshat, but he hadn’t either. So, I followed protocol for walk-outs of people we know - printed his slip, stuck him on the wall of shame, moved on. 

Tonight Asshat and his wife come in for dinner, and my assistant manager waits til the end of their meal to bring their check and bring up his unsettled bill. Thinking nothing of it, my assistant manager says something to the effect of, we added it to your bill tonight so no worries. 

He. Went. Ballistic. 

Started going off on how he paid his tab and his friends at the bar tipped for him (false - and my assistant manager and GM checked the cameras to ensure this). My assistant manager kept saying there was clearly just a miscommunication, but Asshat was having none of it. Started refusing to pay his bill from tonight, said they have been coming there for years and this is no way to treat people. Started laying into ME, saying if they walk in and see I’m on the bar, they leave (false - I would have seen that and I never have). Saying that I never smile and don’t greet people (false - I do smile and I do great people, but honestly do people expect service workers to be smiling 100% of the time they are clocked in?? I smile when it’s appropriate and after that, it’s just my face!). Then, then this man said to my assistant manager, “I have to go. I have to leave. Before I get violent.” 

Then he got up and left. So my assistant manager sat down with the wife to ask what’s up? And the wife said they have been unhappy for a while here and they think it’s a product of our success as a restaurant. Okay. Cool. Don’t fucking come back then? Or if you’re a regular and you know the owners and you feel so fucking comfortable, SAY SOMETHING TO SOMEONE THAT YOUR NEEDS AS PAYING CUSTOMERS ARE NOT BEING MET. 

My GM got the full run down and told us he is going to call Asshat tomorrow and tell him that anyone who threatens violence in his restaurant is not welcome back. 

So, there’s that. But. I am so fucking sick of having entitled pussy little bitches of grown ass men come in and threaten my wellbeing because you don’t want to pay $6. Fuck you.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hey all,
Let me tell you about the time (literally a week ago) these people from an old hotel job I had visited me and requested me to be their server. 
A little back story, I worked at this fancy smancy hotel as an In Room Dining server. I absolutely hated every single manager and coworker in my department and would regularly go and talk to the house keeping managers because they were really nice and our offices were in the same area and they understood my frustration with ""Brad"" my evil ass manager. I eventually got another job at this fine dining restaurant and they offered me a hosting position and said I could move up to a server after two months. I gave the hotel job a notice saying I would be quitting in a few weeks once im a server and they laughed and straight up told me it wouldnt happen. When I eventually did get moved up I gave them a three day notice because fuck them. 

Anyways, a year later I see the house keeping department made a reservation at my new job and requested me for their holiday party. Im excited, im sharing the party with someone else and its all one bill, everything is going perfect. I ended up mainly taking the party myself but whatevs. Their bill was almost $900 for 10 people so I knew we'd get tipped well. NOT.
We get the bills back, there was one for drinks and one for food and there was a 10% tip on each. I was LIVID. I couldnt believe this terrible place was now fucking me over at my new place. But I was mostly hurt that the people I thought I was close with and seemed so excited to see me would do that to me. 

I asked my manager if it would be okay to message my ""friend"" in the group and ask what the fuck happened. My manager is dope and she said id only get in trouble if they complained to the GM (who is a scary but great lady and i was willing to risk it). So i played it cool, I messaged my friend and asked how her dinner was and eventually asked what we could have done better because i was afraid we did something wrong. She said no it was amazing and they will be back again. I said ""great! I was worried because 'Adam' tipped us 10% and I was confused"" she replied back that 'Adam' was so embarrassed and thought that 10% on each bill would make 20% total and he would drop off an envelope of cash to the restaurant the next day. Being assertive got us an extra $42 each! I know $42 isnt much but it was a slower night and this party was one of three of my tables that night. We walked away with $15 each after tip out and I only made less than $60 that night.

The hiring process for being a server has really changed. Everything's on an ipad now and the restaurant now has handheld POS devices (there are still actual POS but the company doesn't want us using them. Yes, it negatively affects tips.) In these changes they got rid of expos and bussers.

Yes, you probably know which chain I'm talking about by now.

So I'm a re-hire, and I was supposed to ""certify"" as a server by combining 2 weeks of training into 4 days. The problem is it has been SO randomly busy on the days I've been training that I haven't been able to practice the handset which is almost like the POS, but when people fire their orders at you, its not as fast to navigate. One modifier, sure. Give me your order and then go back and decide to change your side and ask for 3 more sauces each, now i'm thrown off. 

So today management decided I was wasting my time and made me run food. Which of course, no one knew I was doing so I didn't get tipped out for it. I expo's and ran almost everyone's food. And then, because the shelf is so high, I couldn't reach things that the cooks wouldn't push forward (i'm 4'1""). Another short girl snarked and me, said ""you can reach it, you just want attention""

Later, I watched her get food by climbing on the counter and reaching for it. Oh ok.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work at a fairly new (opened in August) small restaurant as a server on weekends and a bartender/server when I work alone. During the week, Monday-Thursday we only have one person on for each shift (11-5 and then 5-10). My coworker, one of the two usual bartenders, worked the dinner shift by himself on Tuesday night and I had to work the lunch shift on Wednesday morning. He left the bar spotless but left the dining room floor a mess. And I'll tell you right now, we weren't busy enough for him to claim he didn't have time to sweep.

This isn't the first time this has happened. The last time I came in after this bartender, he didn't sweep the floor, left the tables unbussed and unset, didn't wipe the leather sofas down, etc. Basically didn't clean up at all in the dining room. My boss said that he was busy and alone so she just (barely) helped me clean up after him. And he knew I was covering his shift so he could go out with his friends, which makes this even worse because I was doing him a favor.

So today, even though all he did was not sweep the floor, I was furious. Again, she defended him and said he was there alone. There's another bartender who works here and I never have this problem. The dining room is usually fine and I don't mind setting a few tables because we usually don't have all of the necessary silverware to fully set the tables at the end of the night. 

I told her he should be sweeping the floor and that he shouldn't be working there alone if he can't do that before he leaves. She said we can't afford to have more than one person on during the week. I said I don't care, we don't leave the dining room a mess like that, that's not how we do things. And that was the end of the conversation. Maybe I'm a jerk for the attitude I gave her but I'm just fed up at this point.

Later on she says that the cook forgot to prepare something so I had to tell a customer that we couldn't make something that they ordered off of our menu and she goes, ""See THAT'S something to get mad about.""

My personal opinion is that no one should leave the restaurant until it is clean and that the opener should be able to pull the chairs down and do the normal setting up that is required and open the door. I don't think the opener should be required to clean up after the person who closed. It pisses me off that my boss can't just make it a requirement that this bartender should not be leaving the restaurant until it is the way they came in (CLEAN). I am sometimes there until 12-1 in the morning when I get off at 10 because tables are there late and I have to clean up. I would never leave a messy dining room.

We have a 40 year old man who claims they don't know how to sweep (another server who only works on Saturday nights, the busiest night of the week, EVERY WEEK which is another issue I have), another guy who just doesn't sweep and lies and says he doesn't know how when he is asked to sweep and complains when he has to mop or do anything else. Everyone else just wants to make money and leave. That's not how the restaurant business works.

When I have said something in the past, my boss said ""What do you want me to do, punish them?"" Yes actually, I do. I don't blame them, I blame YOU for letting them get away with these things and making it okay. Get it together.  Stop feeling bad for people. Stop letting people walk all over you. Stop being a pushover. Or don't own a restaurant. I can think of many restaurants in the area that wouldn't even tolerate this and would fire them for acting like that.

I'm tired of being taken advantage of. I'm the only one who cleans without question. It's frustrating. If it weren't dead season in the area that I work right now I'd go apply somewhere else.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hey reddit! First time poster here, hope I'm following the guidelines. 

I'm a waitress at a restaurant and we often have families with little children come in. I live in France where people aren't too into gender binaries, so more often than not children will be dressing as they please, which I personally think is great, but it' s a bit difficult to identify(especially since they're children) who's a girl and who's a boy. 

The problem is I often address the little ones as 'little lady' or 'little dude' and often make the mistake of mixing them up. Most reactions I get from parents are quite negative and cold, which makes me feel terrible. 

There's no equivalent, to my knowledge, for 'little buddy' in French, and 'little one' is usually gendered: 'la petite,' 'le petit.'

,TalesFromYourServer,"[23F] I'm pretty new to being a hospo. I have been working at this restaurant for 8 months as a part-timer to support myself financially while pursuing my Bachelor degree. I often get drunken old men hitting on me. At first I didn't know how to react and would feel shitty about it. But as time goes on, I kinda have accepted the fact that it's just how it is like (doesn't mean that it should be) working in a restaurant. People say shits when they are drunk and I get that, so I no longer take it personally. But the other day, there were 20 men (they were huge, buffy and all) came in, they were totally sober, ordered mostly soft drinks, only 3-4 ordered beers. They were super loud, but what did I expect, 20 men, talking at the same time, it would have been even louder if they were all women (just saying lol). One dude actually touched my hand on purpose (but pretended it was an accident) as I was pouring his beer. He began asking me for my name. ""May I ask why do you need to know my name?"" - I asked. 
- C'mon, it's just a name, what's the big deal?
- I'm sorry but I may have to refuse the request of disclosing my name.
- Oh c'mon, tell us your name!!! - a few of them joined in.

I smiled and walked away. I came back and forth to deliver the rest of the drink orders and started taking the food order. My manager also came by to check on them a couple of times to see if they were happy with everything. The same dude who asked for my name told her that I didn't want to tell him my name in a disappointed tone. She asked me (in private) why I didn't just tell them, just make up a name if I was not comfortable with revealing my real name. She listed out a bunch of names that could possibly suit my appearance. I was shocked that she asked me to comply with their demand. Anyway, as I was walking towards them to deliver them their food, I could tell that she was having her eyes on me. The same dude asked me again for my name, this time in an even flirtier tone, so I said: ""Ok so if you really want to know..."" - the 20 of them suddenly stopped talking and listened to what I had to say - ""...You can call me February this month."". I had all of their eyes on me, I continued ""And next month, I'll be March."". They were talking flirty to me the whole night, I was uncomfortable yes, I went home that night with the thought that they would follow me. Lucky, they didn't. What I said to them was total bullshit, it didn't mean anything, didn't stop them from being flirtatious towards me, didn't act as a confrontation or anything, but at least that got me away with that question.

,TalesFromYourServer,"It's trivia night at our Irish pub -- lots of groups drinking 5 drinks over 2 hours between 4 people, always a shitty night for the servers. Lots of blank stares after half-hourly ""can I get you anything""s, an apparently inexplicable question. Very few people eating.

I have one guy come in, mid 20s like me, sit at the last table in my section, seems to be waiting for a friend. I bring two waters and take his order for a cider. Bring the cider back, ask if he's eating, he says no. He's already weird -- has Airpods in, is slow to take them out, makes me say things 2-3 times. Whatever. His friend shows up, orders a Shirley Temple, gets it, I leave them alone.

Whoops -- about 10-15 minutes later she flags me down and asks if they can order food. I was honestly taken aback that they were eating as he'd been so clear when he said they weren't. Okay -- my bad, should have checked in. Take their food orders, grab him another cider, bring it to him. He asks for another water while I'm about to cash out a 10-top, I totally forget. Another 10-15 minutes later I've dropped the food and go back to check on them.

Look, I get that this is two balls dropped on one table. I'm a fast, thorough, friendly server, but shit happens, and you're in a dirty college pub with servers spread thin. 

The kid puts his hand up in my face and then starts gesticulating wildly, both hands in the air very slowly punctuating every other word: ""PLEASE LISTEN TO ME VERY CLOSELY. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BRING ME A GLASS OF WATER. NOW. PLEASE.""

I am so shocked by his tone that he gets an ""....OK,"" a glass of water not NOT slammed down, a dirty look from every other employee in the restaurant eager to check out the asshole at 23, and his check 10 minutes later. Of course he has one of the new white Apple/Goldman Sachs cards.

When I go to take his card, he grabs the check presenter out of my hand and says, ""It has been pointed out to me that I was a bit rude earlier. I apologize."" I don't know if it was his date who yelled at him or my very lovely 4-top across the aisle, but it was certainly a study in entitled, disingenuous apologies.

&lt;p&gt;I am so shocked by his tone that he gets an &amp;quot;....OK,&amp;quot; a glass of water not NOT slammed down, a dirty look from every other employee in the restaurant eager to check out the asshole at 23, and his check 10 minutes later. Of course he has one of the new white Apple/Goldman Sachs cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I go to take his card, he grabs the check presenter out of my hand and says, &amp;quot;It has been pointed out to me that I was a bit rude earlier. I apologize.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know if it was his date who yelled at him or my very lovely 4-top across the aisle, but it was certainly a study in entitled, disingenuous apologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course he leaves a big $0.00 tip on his $60 check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe he had a really bad UTI?&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Apologies in advance. The train of thought ran away from me and it got long.

The guests are fine and I make the most money out of everyone in my restaurant because of my attention to detail (my guests are blown away that I bring them everything they need to package up things to go... That's how low the bar is), but I just can't take my coworkers much longer.

The cooks are great, and for the most part management is too, but the complaints I have seem to fall under the category of ""fights management doesn't feel like having"", so they're let go. Examples:

Servers texting on their phones on the line not only when food needs to be run, but while they're actively using drink and food preparation stations (so phone in one hand while glass being filled with Coke in the other), so they get distracted with their phone and block access to stations. Some servers are even on their phones at the POS stations on the floor in front of guests. I just hate seeing it when I dine out (totally different if you can obviously tell they're on a break or off the clock), and it just contributes to the ""servers are lazy and feel entitled to 20% for doing their basic job"" kind of mentality. I don't know about you guys, but even when it's slow there's always something that needs refilling or stocking. An old GM once told me, ""It's a restaurant! There's always something that needs done."" When I started as a server you couldn't have your phone on you at all, and anyone who needed to call during your shift was allowed to have to restaurant number. I get that we've become more lax, but you can tell these people aren't ALL texting their babysitters about their kids, you know?

Treating cooks like crap. I worked in kitchens (granted, that was prep and dishwashing) before I became a server, but I never had to have anybody give me the ""tip"" to treat my cooks well or get them a drink when it's busy. Not only am I the only server who offers (without being asked by a cook first) to get stuff for the cooks, but I also apologize sincerely when my mistake ringing stuff in causes an issue for the kitchen (these instances are few and far between). We have servers who (it really seems this way) mess up by not ringing in modifiers or sides correctly for almost every table and have to come back and tell the cooks ""for table # I need X, and on the -blah- no Y"", for several tables at a time, and then get mad at the cooks when they don't remember every single thing in between the time they are told and the food comes up. Oh, and no please or thank you to the cooks either. Ever. For anything. Then they talk to each other in front of the line but low enough that they can't be heard about how much the cooks suck and how stupid they are.

Servers making their own floor plan or deciding they're not going to work a modified plan when we have callouts. Had this happen this weekend. We had full coverage (!!!), so enough servers to pair everyone off for four sections plus our bartender and their section. This would have allowed everybody a good mix of large tables and booths, while splitting up the hard-to-seat high tops, but two of the servers took it upon themselves to decide that they each wanted a section to themselves, so they modified the floor plan to have five sections, screwing over the rest of the servers who have partners (one section was now four high-tops and four four-top booths between two servers). And managers didn't care or say anything to them.

Servers can denigrate guests, call them cheap, be outright racist and say they don't want (insert ethnic group here) tables, or refuse to take tables without modifying rotation, and I witnessed a server full on cuss out another team member and come to the back and brag about it, and the MOD just agreed with the server and ""yeah that person does suck at their job, don't they? Heh heh"".

I'm just burned out. I'm only there part time, but it's only been recently that I dread going to work because of these attitudes. I can't afford to cut down my hours and honestly, with my guest survey rate of completion and satisfaction scores and everything I do for the restaurant, they can't afford to lose me. But I just can't do this anymore.

How do you start polishing up your skills to try and move to fine dining? I'm near the capital and thinking something higher end near DC might be a better fit for me. Is there a good resource for learning about wine and spirits and pairings? Do you focus on studying a type of cuisine? I thought fine dining doesn't typically do the application process that, say, Darden does, where you just click a link on a website, so how do you find a job opening? I've been a server for about ten years and I'm always looking to learn more and expand. Just need to know where to start.

And before anyone says anything, I understand that it's possible that these are things I will encounter at the next place I go to. My hope is that management will see these things as unprofessional, as I'm thinking fine dining would, and try to avoid these things specifically, or at least address things if they're not aware of them.",t2_10860r,False,,0,False,[Rant] Get me out of casual corporate!!!,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_f2jr94,False,dark,,public,13,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,13,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1581502852.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This was at a temporary job in a coffee shop, where we sold coffee (duh) as well as ice cream and some snacks.
Apart from 'regular' coffee, we also served coffee with a scoop of ice cream. All good, except the ice cream flavours were a bit out there. Carrot cake, panna cotta, blueberry muffin and so on. Unconventional, but still tasty. Then there were the really bad ones. Such as Honey-rosemary-sourcream, which might go with roast potatoes, but the flavour does not translate well into ice cream.
And the hero (or Villain?) of this story: Black Friday. The feeling retail workers get on that day? That's pretty much how it tasted. 
Supposedly it was Coconut-and-liquorice flavoured. The closest I can come to describing the flavour is a coconut having a nightmare, falling down a chimney straight into hell, just to crawl out of there and onto an ice-cream cone.
Anyway.
It was dark and therefore looked vaguely like another flavour we had, dark chocolate, and a lot of curious customers had asked about it.
I had been warning people away from the flavour for the whole week, letting them sample it before they ordered and so on. Nobody actually bought it after tasting it. Perhaps I shouldn't have talked about company products that way but it was my last week and I was honestly done. They had cut my hours to save money but still expected my to spend three hours a day commuting and their stinginess with equipment actually lead to injuries of long term workers. Selling less ice cream was the least of what they deserved.
Cue the interaction with the unfortunate customer (UC). He walks in, suit and briefcase. I frequently got moved between different locations, and this particular shop was prone to customers who would treat us in the 'what do you know, you're only a barista' way, never mind that they knew less about coffee than most ten year olds.
Yes, coffee does get cold when you let it stand for ten minutes, that's not my fault. Not the point here, though. 
This man already looked the type, but regardless, you greet customers with a smile. 

Me: ""Hello, what would you like today?"" 

UC: ""I'll take a cappuccino with a scoop of the dark chocolate ice cream .""

We didn't have dark chocolate, only Black Friday.

Me: ""Sir, that isn't Dark Ch-"" 

UC: ""Black Friday then, who cares about the names.""

Me: ""Are you sure? It doesn't taste like chocolate, so-"" 

UC: ""Yes, just put it in."" 

Me, thinking I'd try one last time: ""Are you sure you don't want to taste it first? This flavour doesn't really taste all that great."" 

UC: ""I'm sure."" 

Okay then. His money he is wasting, not mine. I make the coffee and drop in an extra large scoop of Black Friday. I do, after all, want to make sure he gets his moneys worth. Besides, there's still tons of ice cream left and we have to chuck it out at the end of the week. 

Me: ""Here you go, have a lovely day!"" 

He takes his coffee, grumbles, and walks out. 
Now fortunately our shop has glass doors, or I wouldn't have seen his priceless expression as he took his first sip.
I finished working there two days later, put his face will remain a fond memory.

Apart from &amp;#39;regular&amp;#39; coffee, we also served coffee with a scoop of ice cream. All good, except the ice cream flavours were a bit out there. Carrot cake, panna cotta, blueberry muffin and so on. Unconventional, but still tasty. Then there were the really bad ones. Such as Honey-rosemary-sourcream, which might go with roast potatoes, but the flavour does not translate well into ice cream.
And the hero (or Villain?) of this story: Black Friday. The feeling retail workers get on that day? That&amp;#39;s pretty much how it tasted. 
Supposedly it was Coconut-and-liquorice flavoured. The closest I can come to describing the flavour is a coconut having a nightmare, falling down a chimney straight into hell, just to crawl out of there and onto an ice-cream cone.
Anyway.
It was dark and therefore looked vaguely like another flavour we had, dark chocolate, and a lot of curious customers had asked about it.

I was a server the night this happened, a Saturday night. My section was closed, but I was helping other servers take out food while doing side work. Another girl server, let's call her Kate.

I watched her go back to the table. It never happened again, thank God. And the manager stood watching as well. Kate stood her ground, and I was so proud of her.

,TalesFromYourServer,"CBA with a TL;DR. Sue me.

Last Saturday I was on duty for a 12 hour, lunch to close shift. At around 8pm, a lone older man comes in to eat. Rather than sit himself down at the table I indicate to him is free, he goes to the bar instead.

This in itself wasn't an immediate red flag but something just seemed *off* about him. He was wearing real scraggy clothes and a worn hat. It's not out of the ordinary and like hell am I going to make an issue based on just his clothing. I remember after eating his starters and removing his plate, I ask him how his food was and he replied something along the lines of ""I'm just praying...""

He casts not so much a glare but a blank stare at me after this, and I put the random response down to perhaps the customer having some sort of mental problem. Not a problem of course, it just caught me off guard a bit at the bizarre reply. I smiled at him and continued about the night.

I then see 10 minutes later that he's ordered our most expensive dish on the menu. This again isn't out of the ordinary but in hindsight this should have immediately been another red flag. Because 5 minutes after his main food arrived, he's standing up putting his coat on and leaving. He doesn't appear to be in any rush and since he's barely touched his food I assume he's gone out for a cigarette.

Wrong.

Instead, I trusted my gut feeling this time and checked the tables on the register. His bill is still active and not paid for. Cue me heading out and coaxing him back inside. It is when doing this that I realise the guy is totally fucking shit faced. He's wobbling around and barely able to stand, so I sit him back at the bar where his food is and politely inform him that his bill has not been paid for.

Cue him insisting he paid with '*another employee*'. There's me, the Bartender, another Waitress and two runners (both of whom don't take payments). So that leaves either Me, Bartender or Waitress as the person he paid with, nobody else is on duty right now. I ask him politely who between the Bartender and Waitress he paid with, and he goes silent. He then demands that I prove he didn't pay.

This is proven after printing his valid bill (*our system is set up so when you pay for a bill you cannot print it off again without Manager approval*). Of course he doesn't believe me and starts swearing at both me and the Bartender. Sensing this whole situation is going to go South I decide the best course is to call the Police. Just to add to this, as the back and fourthing continued with this guy, he **demanded** a police presence.

So, when the cops arrive I give him one last chance to settle the bill and be on his way, he of course instead wants to talk with the police. Bearing in mind throughout all of this I've been with the guy for almost **30 minutes**. Tables that have been sat down during this time have been looking at me expectantly - to them they probably think I'm just standing around, doing nothing.

The Police talk to him and basically give him an option of either going to jail that night for petty theft or pay the bill and leave. He chooses the latter.

Also, I am on mobile so please excuse formatting 

To set the scene, this restaurant is a local “upscale” sushi bar with dim lighting and high booths. Working as a server here we also act as hosts, bussers and bartenders. It’s also important to note that the owner is also the manager and is at the restaurant 24/7 (Literally. He lives there), and that these ladies all worked for a local business in which they had their work shirts on.

This particular day we were dead for lunch and both me and my coworker were in the office talking to the owner. Three ladies walk in and seat themselves, ignoring the “Please wait to be seated” sign. 

The phone rings so my co-worker leaves the office to answer and it happens to be the three ladies sitting at the booth calling to get someone’s attention. Which is fair enough, a little annoying but effective. 

Coworker apologizes for the wait takes their order and goes about business. 

These ladies call her over to complain that they are on lunch and the food is taking too long. She apologizes and assured them it shouldn’t be much longer. They then make a remark about having to call to get anyone’s attention. 

This particular coworker is not someone who messes around. She has worked at the restaurant for years and is not the type to kiss ass in these types of situations. Still she kept her cool and walked off. 

The ladies get their food, then proceed to walk up to the sushi bar to talk with the owner about how rude coworker is. Coworker overheard, and walks over to join the conversation which ends in yelling and 2 of the ladies asking her to “go outside”. 

I eventually am asked to bring them the bill, they pay, stay and talk for a second and then leave. 

When we went to clean the table, these ladies had crushed up sushi rolls, left noodles and meat ALL over the table covered in teriyaki sauce with a note on the receipt that said “dumb bitch”. 

The owner then proceeds to call their work and explain to the manager what they had done. The best part was they all paid separately and with debit cards so we knew all of their names. 

A couple of hours later a woman walks in, hands my coworker $50, apologizes for their behavior, and explains that she is the business owner who had worked her way through college as a server. She then lets her know that she did not want those kinds of people representing her company and they had all been let go.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Pardon the format I am using the telephone.

I am a waiter. 

A guy I have served over the past week who seems alright. Kind of a lad, drank craft beer. In town for business. I work next to a hotel so we get travellers. 

I had served him for most nights this week and we had goodish banter. He was laughing and kind of crass, but kind. He was talking about a relative or in law or whatever in trouble of some kind. 


Because I’m a waiter I’m mostly half listening to any long winded story because I’m subtly trying to land a polite /funny closing remark, as I have shit to do. American Man 3 tables down waves his bloody hands in the air foolishly like a child as he’s literally just finished his cocktail and wants another immediately. Main meals of another table hit the pass as Craft Beer Bro asks “what makes a guy do this?” or something to that effect. 


“Even a broken clock is right twice a day.” As I laugh and roll my eyes and do the ever so awkward I am leaving now sir dance and walk away with a full tray. Obviously running my tables mains next and facing the wrath of blithering American Man after. 


I was expecting Craft Beer Bro to laugh and see the bigger picture. I was busy, you have your drinks and I have provided you with a small amount of free company. Instead as I’m half turned with a full tray in my hands and a plate in my other says loudly “Not if it’s a 24 hour clock” and almost immediately starts speaking again about himself. 


What a fucking down buzz interaction. Honestly. To tell you the truth his response and general clingy-ness has tainted the otherwise good dynamic we had. His inability to see through the customer/server dynamic made me have to explain to him that “sir I really must leave there are people needing me”. That cost me about 12 seconds on my American Man delivery, which changed the way I had to serve him. That in turn meant the reserved party of 8 was held up. I’ll tell you, that didn’t bode well for American Mans future cocktails. We then got slammed for 4 hours till the end of our liquor license and I got home at 2 in the morning after cleaning up to start work again today at 8 am on my double.

,TalesFromYourServer,"*Obligatory sorry for format, on mobile*

I had an older couple at one of my tables a few weeks ago; the woman was very polite but her husband was a real piece of work. Rude from the start, never said please or thank you, you all know the type. 

He ordered a pasta dish from our menu that was a mix of spaghetti noodles and veggie “noodles” with chicken and a light sauce. It very clearly states in the description that both veggie noodles and real pasta are in the dish. 

When I brought it out, he looked at it and said it wasn’t what he ordered- it was meant to be all veggie noodles. I told him that that’s how the dish is prepared, but I was happy to have it remade with veggie noodles only. My restaurant really pushes that- we’d rather remake it to the guest’s satisfaction than take it off the bill. 

He said no. I asked if he was sure. His wife interjected, saying that he was diabetic and wouldn’t eat the noodles. I offered again to have it remade, especially since it was for a medical reason. 

He again declined, saying he didn’t want me taking the dish to the kitchen, have the cooks “man-handle” the chicken and put it on the new pasta. I told him that was not procedure, and that when we make a new dish we remake all of it, and would never reuse parts of the old one. 

At this point, he turned to me and very loudly and aggressively asked, “WAS IT THE “N” OR THE “O”??? 

I can’t even begin to tell you how that condescending bullshit made me feel, I mean he had a medical issue with the dish and I was just doing my job and trying to help. I couldn’t believe he’d spoken to me that way. I walked away from the table without a word, told my manger, and he finished the table for me so I didn’t have to go back over.

&lt;p&gt;At this point, he turned to me and very loudly and aggressively asked, “WAS IT THE “N” OR THE “O”??? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even begin to tell you how that condescending bullshit made me feel, I mean he had a medical issue with the dish and I was just doing my job and trying to help. I couldn’t believe he’d spoken to me that way. I walked away from the table without a word, told my manger, and he finished the table for me so I didn’t have to go back over. The rudeness of customers just boggles me sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"In a post earlier I mentioned moving from Dallas to a suburb to get away. I was still in the industry though. Anyways. I started to get to know the people I'm the area. Moving to a suburb I found out fast that Everyone in the industry knew each other. Obviously this was a smaller city than Dallas. It didn't matter if someone worked at Applebee's or a local bar everyone hung out. 

So a couple weeks into my new life we were hanging out in the parking lot of National Chain Restaurant. Every weekend a group of 20-30 people met up here to drink and hang out. Sometimes if would be a different location but it usually started here. It was located off a busy street in this city but the parking lot was hidden away behind trees and landscaping. Some people brought beer. Some brought other stuff. After a couple hours the beer and liquor that people had brought was running low. Then I hear someone say ""Call the rolling bartender."" I was like wtf is that. 

Ten minutes later this guy pulls up. Pops his truck and he literally had a complete bar set up in his trunk. He had everything. Mixers. Ice. Every liquor you could think of. The guy charged $5 for a beer and $10 for a mixed drink. And he sold cheap bottles of liquor of $50. Premium bottles for more.

To this day I can't believe it. I got to know the guy after time. And found out he was doing it to pay for college. He claimed he made $1k a week working maybe 8 hours: Friday and Saturday 2a-6am. Based on what I saw I don't doubt he was making that much.

I have always said if you want to find something a server, or someone in the industry, will know how to find it. One night, as manager, I was taking a smoke break, cigs, a couple blocks from the restaurant I managed. I guess looking back I looked a little sketchy because I was standing by a fence smoking.

,TalesFromYourServer,"On mobile, so apologies.

I work at a pretty popular country styled restaurant/bar in NY State. This passed weekend we had a snowstorm and I had to spend an extra half hour unearthing my car to get to work. Once I got there I found out that every single server called out (6 in total). All we had were two bartenders and myself as the runner, so the bartenders had their own table section as well as the bar.

Because we were so short staffed, I had to do all the servers set-up work, move tables, as well as stocking the kitchen before we open. So by the time we opened, I was already over being there.

The fun part about the night was that the two bartenders enjoy taking breaks...a lot of breaks (mainly to take snaps of their butt and complain about how much work they do). It was a little relieving to see them have to do something that night, but it also had some drawbacks. Almost every order was rang in wrong, I had to spend extra time taking food back to the kitchen and bag it because they don't know how to add ""to go"" on a ticket let alone knowing what the table and seat numbers are. It was an all around nightmare of a night.

On a slow night, I'd total about $60-70 in tips (2% of each of the servers' food sales). That night, I got $22 and I'm livid. I talked to my manager the next day and she said she'd look into it. I told her ""I hope I'm not only worth 22 dollars.""

,TalesFromYourServer,"I'm invited to a friends birthday to a newish restaurant. It's been open about 6 months, tacqureia type place, caters to the 20-30 something crowd. She calls a a week ahead says a party of about 25 will be there.  Everyone shows up within 5-10 mins of when she said. It so happens, it's a Saturday and one of the dating apps are having a meet up so the place is pretty slammed. We get our table, seated. Drink orders are taken. The server is being shadowed by a trainee.  I don't think anyone expects lighting fast service in this scenario...at least most of us didn't. 

Long story short, drinks slowly come out. Then eventually a couple orders come out. Then nothing.  Etiquette eventually was overcome by hunger and those with food began eating. The server and the kitchen were obviously having a bad night and the server didn't have his system down because a lot of the orders were just wrong and tickets were going to the wrong table. But that's not the point of this story. The point of this story is when faced with adversity -- how well do you handle it while other's are not?

Unfortunately one of guests in our party failed. **Miserably**. We'll call her ""Lisa"". 

Lisa's food along with 5 others didn't come out. It likely didn't' get put in or went to another table. But instead of having a polite conversation asking about what's happening. She proceeds to resort to passive-aggressive insults about every time the server passes by or an employee is within earshot -- the speed of service is critiqued, ""how simple it is to make a taco"", how she's not tipping this guy, repeated threats of ""yelping"" (best way to win over the staff of any business). 

Lisa eventually gets her food and of course it's not good enough and the server again is riddled with passive-aggressive insults. Enough to the point where other guests are annoyed with her behavior they begin to lay into her. She is now obligated to start defending herself for her shitty behavior.

It&amp;#39;s been open about 6 months, tacqureia type place, caters to the 20-30 something crowd. She calls a a week ahead says a party of about 25 will be there.  Everyone shows up within 5-10 mins of when she said. It so happens, it&amp;#39;s a Saturday and one of the dating apps are having a meet up so the place is pretty slammed. We get our table, seated. Drink orders are taken. The server is being shadowed by a trainee.  I don&amp;#39;t think anyone expects lighting fast service in this scenario...at least most of us didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, drinks slowly come out. Then eventually a couple orders come out. Then nothing.  Etiquette eventually was overcome by hunger and those with food began eating. The server and the kitchen were obviously having a bad night and the server didn&amp;#39;t have his system down because a lot of the orders were just wrong and tickets were going to the wrong table. But that&amp;#39;s not the point of this story. The point of this story is when faced with adversity -- how well do you handle it while other&amp;#39;s are not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately one of guests in our party failed. &lt;strong&gt;Miserably&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;#39;ll call her &amp;quot;Lisa&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa&amp;#39;s food along with 5 others didn&amp;#39;t come out. It likely didn&amp;#39;t&amp;#39; get put in or went to another table. But instead of having a polite conversation asking about what&amp;#39;s happening. She proceeds to resort to passive-aggressive insults about every time the server passes by or an employee is within earshot -- the speed of service is critiqued, &amp;quot;how simple it is to make a taco&amp;quot;, how she&amp;#39;s not tipping this guy, repeated threats of &amp;quot;yelping&amp;quot; (best way to win over the staff of any business). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa eventually gets her food and of course it&amp;#39;s not good enough and the server again is riddled with passive-aggressive insults. Enough to the point where other guests are annoyed with her behavior they begin to lay into her. She is now obligated to start defending herself for her shitty behavior. &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I don’t work at this place anymore, but I thought I would share this story-

It was Day of the Dead. In this small town there are only a few nicer sit down restaurants and we happen to be one in front of the townhall. They do most of the fair/events there.

This is the first time they had done something like this for Day of the Dead, so the co owner wasn’t expecting a lot of people.

We didn’t have a dishwasher so one of the servers changed places for that one day, leaving me and another girl as the only servers for the day.

Mind you that also means we would clean tables and host. It’s that type of restaurant.

It hits 7PM and people start coming. At first it isn’t a lot, but by 30 minutes we start getting one table after another. In 20 minutes the whole place got full, 120 seats taken. In total each of us had about 10-12 tables each. 

Taking drinks was the worst, not only were we taking forever to fill up cups with sodas, but we also ran out of cups so we started using beer glasses or whatever we found to be a cup (lmao). Keep in mind I had been asking for more cups for a month.

We take drinks and people start ordering, we put so many orders in, there is only one sushi guy and one kitchen person.

We start freaking out because of all the people coming in, we ask the server that is washing dishes to help, but he pretty much said “not my problem today” lol

Food is taking at least 40 min to come out. Even after pressuring the sushi chef, it is impossible for him to make so many rolls at the same time. Not to mention we have a lot of items on the menu.

We are literally running everywhere, at one point I remember the other server saying “I wanna cry but like there is no time to cry” and we both laughed about it.

I was honestly surprised at how no customer actually left, their food and drinks were taking forever to get to their tables. Nobody also made any complaints, and some people who noticed we were only two servers left $20+ tips.

At the end only one table was left. We were so tired to clean but also so relieved that the night was over. It was a mess, specially the section where we were making the micheladas/wine margaritas.

This happened close to 15 years ago so details may not be exact.

I had an embarrassing but overall great experience when I covered for someone in the deli area. I ran the register in a popular convenience store/deli/sandwich shop in Pennsylvania that has locations in many states but most are in Pennsylvania.

First time ever making a sandwich and it was for the District Manager (DM) no one told me we had horseradish sauce and regular horseradish. I used regular when he had ordered sauce.

He took a big bite made kind of a face and said ""well that was strong""

He knew I had never worked the deli before so he asked if I knew we had horseradish sauce and regular. I think I must have gone a bit white at this.

He smiled and laughed and said he was glad it was his sandwich and not a customer's order I messed up on.

My manager was ready to get in my face but the DM got in her face and asked why I hadn't been properly trained and shown the difference...it was just me in the deli for the first time ever with minimal training making hot dogs, stuffed pretzels, coffee, breakfast sandwiches, and the made to order sandwiches/salads...trial by fire I guess.

I was never asked to work the deli again but if they had actually shown me where everything was I would have been fine...I had worked at Little Caesars for years before this so it's not like I'm food inept just needed to know that we had very similarly named igredients and toppings for the sandwiches.

sweetheart.

Mr. Smurf: you got a nice laugh too! I wonder how you can laugh at night.

,TalesFromYourServer,"First time posting and am on mobile so please excuse any errors. 

A little information for you. I live in the deep south and work for a very popular local seafood restaurant in my area. People come from all over the country to try our seafood and we are often very busy, especially during crawfish season/lent. The owners are very nice people and will do almost anything they can to make the customers happy. That is fine, however people often take advantage of this, and often are incredibly rude. Trust me, between myself and my coworkers, we have seen it all. 

The place where i work employs a lot of high school and college students and in order to help us maintain a working life and keep up with school, we close fairly early during the week nights (7 o’clock Monday-Thursday and 5 o’clock on Sunday). But when I say “close” I mean we stop taking orders. So someone could come in at 6:59 on a Monday night and stay until 11. They just wouldn’t be able to order anything (yes this actually happened). The most annoying part of all of this is that most of our side work can’t be started until everybody leaves. 

So this happened a couple of months ago, probably around October. This particular story isn’t anything too bad, but it just goes to show how entitled some of the people we deal with are. It was a Thursday night, and during the late summer-fall, we usually aren’t terribly busy. We had started cleaning up and getting ready to leave about 15 minutes before closing, and everyone was pretty much ready to leave. We had a couple of tables but they were finishing up and I thought I was going to get home early, but of course that’s not what happened. About five minutes before we close, a big group of about 6 or 7 people came in. Our policy is if you are in the restaurant before 7, you can order, and of course these people took their precious time deciding what they want. They finally ordered at 7:05 and to make matters worse, they ordered three orders of snow crab, which is very messy and easily takes longer to get ready than anything else. In addition, it meant our boiler had to stay an extra fifteen to twenty minutes waiting for the orders to be ready. So not only was the wait and kitchen staff aggravated, but so was the boiler. But their food comes up and they take their time eating, even though it is obvious we were closed and ready to go. We had stacked the chairs up on the other side of the restaurant (which we only do if people seem to not be aware that we are closed or they just don’t care), the lights in seafood market were off, and just about all of my coworkers were sitting in the waiting area on their phones. Finally, about thirty minutes after we closed, one of the women from the table gets up and starts heading towards the counter. I was relieved as I think she just needs a to go box, but of course I was wrong. 

Me: Hi, do y’all need some to go boxes?

RL (Rude Lady): Actually I wanted to place an order to go. 

This happens fairly often, and usually people are understanding, so like I usually do I told her our kitchen had closed thirty minutes ago and that I was sorry. 

RL: I just want some chicken. It’s for my daughter. 

Me: I’m sorry but we shut down our kitchen half an hour ago. Everything is turned off. 

RL: Well can’t you just turn it back on?

Me: I don’t think they can do that ma’am. 

RL: Are you kidding me? All I want is some chicken and it’s not even for me it’s for my daughter. Is there any way you can do it for me? 

Me: Everything is already put up or shut down. 

RL: Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaase? Pretty please? 

RL began to beg like a five year old girl asking her parents to buy her a chocolate bar, and it was almost embarrassing. I’m not even kidding. Everything in me wanted to be like “Yes, let me have the cook turn everything back on again, dirty up all the dishes we just cleaned, and stay an extra ten to fifteen minutes longer because you came in 5 minutes before we closed and just now decided you want chicken. 

Me: I’m sorry. There isn’t anything I can do.

RL: Can you go back and ask if they can do it?

Me: Ma’am I promise you they already closed. 

RL: Can you please just go check?

I was pretty aggravated at this point as I was trying to do my side work and she had wasted a good five minutes of my time, but her insisting I go ask the kitchen to confirm what I already knew only made me angrier. Our kitchen manager works full days on Thursday, and she was still there making sure everything was being done correctly. So I went up to her and explained everything that was happening. 

KM (Kitchen Manager): What’s wrong with you?

Me: This lady won’t leave me alone about some chicken tenders and I’ve been telling her we are closed. Please just tell me you can’t so she will leave me alone. 

KM: Well let me see if we still have the batter. 

Me: KM, please. 

Before she could say anymore, one of the cooks confirmed that, shocker, everything was turned off and the batter was thrown away already. So I went to tell her this, but RL still didn’t seem to get it. 

Me: Ma’am, they said everything is off and shit down for the night. 

RL: Okay so what am I supposed to tell my daughter? 

Me: I don’t know, but we can’t make it. 

RL: This is ridiculous. Y’all didn’t even tell me the kitchen was closing. 

First of all, that’s isn’t even our responsibility, and secondly we told her and her entire party that this was going to be the last order and the kitchen was going to be shutting down after that. 

I had been up since 5:30 that morning, and had come to work directly after school, so naturally I was pretty grumpy. I was getting sick of this lady, but thankfully my supervisor walked back to the counter. 

Me: Supervisor, can you please help this lady. 

RL: She said you can’t make me a chicken basket. I have the money for it right here.

S: Ma’am, or kitchen closed over half an hour ago. We can’t do that. 

RL: This is ridiculous! I guess my daughter just won’t eat tonight. 

And she stormed back to her table. 

My supervisor looked at me and I explained what had happened. 

S: If she needs chicken that badly, she should just go to McDonalds. There is literally one a mile either way down the road. 

Me: I don’t know but I am done with people. 

The group ended up not leaving until 8 o’clock but I had gotten all my work done and was able to leave after we had stacked all the chairs. I just wonder if she ever went and got chicken.",t2_2xeoijal,False,,0,False,If you need chicken that badly just go to McDonalds.,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_f1j0dg,False,dark,,public,65,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,65,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1581327934.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time posting and am on mobile so please excuse any errors. &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So. One of my work buddies, we'll call him crash, is probably the best part of the restaurant. Seriously, any story that begins with ""So, Crash...."" you know its gonna be good. I'm certain everyone has a crash in their restaurant and when this post is done, I want to hear your stories about crash.

Ok, this is the earliest one I know, so one day, crash is cleaning up his section, and in a freak turn, somehow shatters the broom handle and gashes his finger something gnarly, he then proceeds to look at it, calmly tell the manager, then drive himself to the hospital while leaving a trail.

Crash for some reason is nuts enough to attempt to carry up to 7 plates worth of food with no tray at all and it always scares me. 

Every single time when he sees a broken cup or ramekin, he always proceeds to shatter the thing under his boot before throwing the pieces away.

During late nights, big high school and college groups love him because he will roast you to the ends of the earth or until you say stop. They always take turns going around the table, roasting each individual person.

One day, when we were completing our back work, he was stacking appetizer plates and not 10 seconds after he was done, about 12 plates just came crashing down and shattering in a beautiful shower of ceramic. He then proceeds to stomp on the broken pieces, creating more debris before cleaning.

He takes his shirt of regularly when we're closing and cleaning FOH. One time, he went full undies, it was traumatizing.

One of the most recent stories I have just happened a few days ago. We were getting absolutely killed that day and one time when he was running empty plates and glasses back, three of them were slipping, so as he tightened his grip, he shattered all of them, embedding glass shards into his hands and arms, but proceeded to continue working.

This is something that involves me, the two of us spent a good hour looking through.... questionable videos just to find one he saw once that had peacocks strutting in the background, we were on a mission. We found it and never felt so proud.

Bonus story: This isn't work related, but I figured I'd share anyway, he once accidentally beat the hell out of two guys when he was younger because he thought they were just roughhousing. As it turns out, it was a legit fight and he just waltzed in and won on accident.

&lt;p&gt;He then grabs the bill at the end and tips her 5 bucks on a 90 dollar dinner. I left a 10 dollar bill (all I had in cash) for her but sis deserved a good raise. I’ve never in my life been so annoyed so I know she was too. If only they were allowed to curse&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I was in two minds whether to write this post or not but I can't sleep because of this experience I had with guests today in the restaurant and I need  to get it off my chest. I am trying to be as vague as possible when speaking about the guests but this is my first time posting so if I'm breaking a rule please tell me so I can take this down.

I got seated a large family this afternoon. Some others servers warned me to 'keep an eye' on them for putting plastic in their food or just finding ways to get out of paying the bill etc. This was purely based on stereotyping on the other servers part and not because they recognised them as regulars. 

However, I believe in treating everyone the same so I made a real effort with them and I really enjoyed serving their table, spending a lot of time with them, making the kids balloon animals etc. They were super nice and chatty, the kids were gorgeous (especially their little blue eyed baby) and polite, the parents made them all behave themselves, the kids were asking the parents if it was ok if they had certain things off the menu and they were just generally really enjoyable guests to serve. 

They finish their meal and I'm at a waiter station doing something or other and the dad pops his head round and said he's just nipping to the loo and I said I'll grab him the bill. I go to the table to drop the bill and they're all gone. I said to my manager that the Dad was in the toilet and to go check if he was still there. Dad comes out of the toilet and I said 'the bill's on the table' and he was like 'oh yes thanks, love' then a manager came to me and said T20 is waiting to pay his bill. Dad then starts walking towards the door/host stand saying 'I just pay it down here right?' and I was like well I can get you a PDQ and do it. At this point we are at the door and the PDQ at the host stand decides it's not going to work. He says 'would cash be better for you, love?' and I said whatever is best for him but I can get a working machine if he waits a sec. He says 'I've got cash in the van, I'll just go and get it."" and that's when I knew that it was game over. 

He went outside to the van where the whole family was loaded in, got in and drove off. As in the title, the bill they left behind was £200.

Walk outs happen, I know that. But, in 15 years of working in hospitality, I've never felt this hurt by one. I spent so much time with them and they played me like a fiddle. My managers were fine about it on my end and said I couldn't have done anything more than I did. Even if I got the PDQ working he would have said his card wasn't working/he didn't have it and needed to get his cash out of the van so it was a no win situation. I just feel like a complete mug for falling for it and both angry and humiliated. It completely ruined my day tbh.

Now, onto the issue. Saturday I came into work with a headache. Not a HUGE deal, but it eventually evolved into a migraine which caused me to vomit. I told him that I vomited and it was due to a migraine. He asked if I was asking to go home. I said, well I certainly cant stay here if I'm vomiting with tears in my eyes from a migraine. He continued to push me and disrespect me until I snapped and asked for him and another manager to come into the office because I was sick of him.

,TalesFromYourServer,"At first I thought this manager was just one of those power hungry/rose up the ladder kind of guy. So I didn’t think to much about it. I figured he treated me just like he treated everyone else. But I was wrong. 

He literally nit picks everything and tell me  I do everything wrong, yells at me for the smallest things, and always threatens me to write me up for anything. Says when he was a server this/that. 

First let me tell you about myself. I rarely break the rules, I don’t like getting in trouble and I respect everyone. I always go above and beyond for this company who could care less and could replace me easily. When my coworkers or other managers hear that I got yelled at they are surprised because they know I don’t act out. 

Anyways this manager follows me around waiting to see if I do something he disapproves and it’s uncomfortable I feel like I always have to be looking over my shoulder and I see his looking. Even if I’m just chatting with coworkers when it’s slow. We have a strict dress code policy which I follow but as a very petite female that’s hard. I had to get dress pants from the kids section because adults dress pants don’t fit well. And kids dress pants are different from adults they always have to put some weird zipper here or since it’s kids clothes it’s tighter than normal in certain areas. For the whole two weeks I was going to different stores to find it. He would pick at me every day “in (insert how many days left of the 2 wks I had to find dress pants) I get to write you up” and he would tell me I’m not looking and being lazy. He even told me just because dress pants is in the dress pants section it doesn’t make it dress pants. I had to go to my GM and show him the struggles of finding dress pants in the adults section so I got a pass for my kids dress pants. This manager tries to send me home if I have a spot on my dress pants but let’s other people come work in sweatpants or leggings. That’s when I saw the difference in behavior. 

We also recently have a new party policy where 8 or more guest we have to split the party. Which means we have to split tips and it sometimes sucks. I noticed I’m always one of the servers who get stuck taking parties when he’s manager. I always asked why is it my section gets closed off 40 minutes and he always says well we need to sit a party there but other sections would be open. Or he would make me take parties if it’s not even in my section. I would take it without saying anything because again it’s my job. 

We also have a new no phone policy at work. He lets other people use phones but if I take my phone out for emergencies he tells me he will write me up and send me home even though I told him it was for emergency. He knows I don’t like confrontations or getting in trouble so he always throws it in my face that he has the power to write me up. 

I also had asthma since I was 2 and I get sick not a lot but a good amount of times. My other managers are understanding but when I tell this manger I need to take my inhaler or nebulizer he thinks I’m lying to get out of work. He just straight up told me if I’m really that sick I shouldn’t work for then anymore. 

It’s gotten to the point where I tell other servers I don’t respect him as a manager anymore. They see how he treats me and yells at me and they ask how do I put up with it. They just see me take it and it angers them to let someone walk all over me.. again I don’t like getting in trouble so I don’t know what to do. 

He’s also in charge of picking who gets what section which is why I’m always in the party section.. not only that he likes to give up my section to someone else if I’m not in the party section for once and make me food run or put me in the party section. I’ve talked to other managers how the section works and they say it’s based on rotation but I’m always back there and other have noticed it. I consider myself a good server and can make up to $250 working doubles but lately I’ve been making $100-150 all day because of taking parties all day and it’s taking a toll.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Can we just talk about how when you are working an incredibly busy shift, doing the job of 3 different people and you don't have time for management's shit.

Last night I was serving a busy Saturday night. I got sat with a 4 top, 3 top and a 2 top then was sat with a 9 top all within a minute of each other. I don't have a busser, food runner and the bartender was useless.

The kitchen was late to push out food. The bartender wasn't making my drinks.

I was doing a damn fine job. I had my flow. I had my course of action planned out. It was going great. Everyone had what they needed in a timely manner.

Then the owner steps in. Tells me to change my course of action. Offer them their free salads before the apps come out. I planned my time for my salads to come out after the apps. Not before. So she makes me reroute myself to go to the 9 top and ask if they want their salads before the apps. They say yes. I tell her I just don't have the time to make and dress 9 salads. She looks like she's going to rip my head off. She said they've been waiting too long. I mention how they specifically requested that they not be rushed. They even said, we will drink for an hour before our meals. The owner didn't care. Then on my way back to the salad station from the table I get buzzed for my apps. So I have to bring the apps out. And now I look bad at my table for making it seem like they're apps wouldn't be out yet.

They took so long eating all their little apps that the other servers stole my salads and used them for themselves. Great. Fantastic.

Then the owner starts pushing me on my other tables. Rushing the bills and the desserts. The other tables see how busy I am and tell me they are in no rush and that they are perfectly fine with their after dinner coffees. Everyone is conversing and laughing and having a great time. No one is waiting an unreasonable time. They all want to sit and enjoy each other's company.

She rushes the bills for my other 3 smaller tables. Throwing me through a loop and changing my course of action again, causing me to fall behind. If you make me do something that you think is first priority when there is something else I should be doing that really is first priority that you aren't considering because you aren't actually serving, then you are messing everything up.


She dropped the checks on my tables without adding their info to the bills. Then persecuted me for it not being on there already. Then one table wanted their bill split so I had to double back to split their check. I'm in the middle of doing that and she knows I have a birthday card (money off their check) and a gift card on the other split half. Before I even split their bill she adds them on. But the POS is shot and and it didn't effectively split their bill. So it all got jumbled up. Then instead of giving the gift card back with the remaining balance on it she thought she'd save herself time by just offering the rest of the gift card in cash from my own bank. I tell her I don't have a bank because there was no time to get one from the moment I walk in the door so she's mad at me. And she's holding me up this entire time by making me do this while everyone else really is not in a rush. So the whole check got completely messed up.

Whatever, I'm over it at this point. I'm not showing her that I'm mad but I'm also not being apologetic because it's really just messing up my flow completely. All the time I'm spending trying to communicate with her what I really nerd to do with my tables I could be doing something else more important.

Then I start making a tray of 9 salads finally, because the other servers stole the ones I made. And this other server comes up and literally starts stealing the salads directly off the tray I'm in the process of making. Oh, not to mention earlier she accused me of stealing the salads I made for myself too. I was just about ready to rip her head off at this point. She is a known thief. A lot of times she will straight up steal the bread baskets I make for myself as well. So we make bread baskets, place them on a tray and leave them at the bar so the bartender can put the drinks in our trays and we can bring them both to the tables. She always steals the ones I make for myself. Over it.

So now I'm doubling back again because I'm making salads for myself and she's taking them off my tray for herself. Over it. I told her to put them back.

I'm just so sick of everyone wasting time. Oh and the kitchen! The kitchen will buzz me when I didn't have food up. So I'd go into the kitchen to see what they have to update me on. And no one's saying anything. They're just standing there not looking up to tell me. So the whole night I was going ""what, what, what..."" ""WHAT DID YOU BUZZ ME FOR"" waiting a solid minute and a half for them to tell me what would take them 10 seconds to say.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Um.. first reddit post. After seeing similar stories I felt like I should bring this one here. I have many more if anyone would want me to write them down, this is just the most recent as of now.

Formatting apology- I’m on mobile.

Oh and English is my first language so tear me up.

About a month ago while hosting at a (fake) italian restaurant, I was taking an older man and his wife to a booth. The only booth we had availiable which wasn’t dirty was in the café area (what we call our bar area). I asked the wife if this was okay and she said yes. The man said nothing. I attempted to take them to the booth and as I was sitting the silverware down the man began to berate me,” You are REALLY trying to seat us in the corner of the damn bar! You are so disrespectful and disgusting to your elders. Find us a new table now out there!” He gestured to the dining room.

I dont deal well with stress. I have severe social and pressure based anxiety which I have to take xanax for at the beginning of each day but the dose is only strong enough to keep me calm during normal (what shouldn’t be stressful) events. So getting yelled at infront of an entire restaurant will definitely still set me off.

My face was red and I felt hot as I took him to a dirty booth in the dining room and quietly told him,” I’m sorry sir. I will be right back to clean this off for you.” Well, he did not like this as he continued his ranting and raving at me about how unprepared I was, how they should not have to wait on a booth to be cleaned, and how he could have my job taken from me for being so incompetent. I know it isn’t my fault as the busser hasnt been able to get to the tables yet but being yelled at and humiliated was too much and I actually started crying on the job. Yeah, I’m an adult. That makes it worse. I cried silently but I’m sure it was visible while i got their table ready for them and the guy seemed satisfied. The waitress taking them told me not to worry and took her time to check her other tables before greeting them (making them wait 5 minutes) but I’m unsure if it really did anything for them. 
May I add that the wife never spoke up at all while the husband tore me a new one? Yeah she just let it happen.

Anyway word got back to my managers about what happened the next day and now when it gets busy they take me off the floor and have me roll silverware because they don’t think I can handle a rush anymore.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This is a big rambly dump of a single shift I had, it's a bit long but I wonder if any other bar workers have had similar experiences?

2 weeks ago I had the worst shift I've had in my professional career. I work at a bar that turns into a club, and as we're open the latest in the area (we close at 4am/4.30am) we get incredibly busy.

To start, one of my managers called in sick so I had to start my shift 5 hours earlier. This involved working a few hours of our food service, and the very first customer I served argued with me for 10 minutes because her favourite meal wasn't on the menu, and then because her son didn't like any of the drinks available with his meal deal, and then finally because she thought it was too expensive. And then, in fabulous customer tradition, complained that her food was too cold, but her son's food burned his mouth. Our team leader gave her free dessert and she ordered ALL of them for just her and her son, and expected them ALL free, and doggy bagged to go.

Roll forward a few hours, I go to change a barrel and the top explodes and covers me in beer. My boss wouldn't let me go home to wash or change, so I look and smell like I'm just fallen into a swamp. When a coworker comes in at the start of their shift, they complain to the team leader about it, who basically tells her to deal with it.

As it starts to get busier into the night, 10-11pm, this family comes in. They ask for Moet. We don't have Moet. I apologise and suggest our fanciest Prosecco or white wine. They scoff and tell me specifically to get some class for even suggesting anything other than champagne. They order about 8 drinks and change their mind about 5 of them after I've poured and served them. They refuse to pay, they call my team leader over and tell him I've messed their entire order up. My TL says ""that's not a problem, tell me what you want and I'll get it for you"". No no, they wouldn't want to waste product, they'll just take these drinks for free. Thankfully, my TL stands up for me and says whatever they drink, they have to pay for.

Around 2am, the other local bars close and about 100 people flood into our 120person bar. We're serving as quick as we can, impressively so, everyone's partying, it's starting to become a better night. And then comes an asshole, let's call him Slurry Douchebag. So drunk, he can't even order his next drink. I say if he can say it, he can have it, but if not I'm not serving him any alcohol. He suddenly finds his voice and tells me he's gonna punch me out and starts trying to climb the bar. I radio a doorman and he's immediately thrown out.

Not even 10 minutes later, another guy reaches across the bar and PULLS. MY. HAIR to get me to serve him next. Everyone on the bar and even those waiting to be served were absolutely shook. We refuse to serve him. He later comes up after last call, apologises, hands me £1 tip and asks for his drink now. I tell him we've stopped serving but appreciate the apology. He rips the pound coin from my hand and tells me I'm useless.

And to top it all off, I got put on solo rebottling duty (basically carrying all the stock up from the cellar to restock the bar, which is honestly a more effective weights workout than any class I've taken in the gym), and then my taxi took 30 minutes to arrive, so I didn't get home til 5.30am.

Our team leader gave her free dessert and she ordered ALL of them for just her and her son, and expected them ALL free, and doggy bagged to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roll forward a few hours, I go to change a barrel and the top explodes and covers me in beer. My boss wouldn&amp;#39;t let me go home to wash or change, so I look and smell like I&amp;#39;m just fallen into a swamp. When a coworker comes in at the start of their shift, they complain to the team leader about it, who basically tells her to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it starts to get busier into the night, 10-11pm, this family comes in. They ask for Moet. We don&amp;#39;t have Moet. I apologise and suggest our fanciest Prosecco or white wine. They scoff and tell me specifically to get some class for even suggesting anything other than champagne. They order about 8 drinks and change their mind about 5 of them after I&amp;#39;ve poured and served them. They refuse to pay, they call my team leader over and tell him I&amp;#39;ve messed their entire order up. My TL says &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s not a problem, tell me what you want and I&amp;#39;ll get it for you&amp;quot;. No no, they wouldn&amp;#39;t want to waste product, they&amp;#39;ll just take these drinks for free. Thankfully, my TL stands up for me and says whatever they drink, they have to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2am, the other local bars close and about 100 people flood into our 120person bar. We&amp;#39;re serving as quick as we can, impressively so, everyone&amp;#39;s partying, it&amp;#39;s starting to become a better night. And then comes an asshole, let&amp;#39;s call him Slurry Douchebag. So drunk, he can&amp;#39;t even order his next drink. I say if he can say it, he can have it, but if not I&amp;#39;m not serving him any alcohol. He suddenly finds his voice and tells me he&amp;#39;s gonna punch me out and starts trying to climb the bar. I radio a doorman and he&amp;#39;s immediately thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even 10 minutes later, another guy reaches across the bar and PULLS. MY. HAIR to get me to serve him next. Everyone on the bar and even those waiting to be served were absolutely shook. We refuse to serve him. He later comes up after last call, apologises, hands me £1 tip and asks for his drink now. I tell him we&amp;#39;ve stopped serving but appreciate the apology. He rips the pound coin from my hand and tells me I&amp;#39;m useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off, I got put on solo rebottling duty (basically carrying all the stock up from the cellar to restock the bar, which is honestly a more effective weights workout than any class I&amp;#39;ve taken in the gym), and then my taxi took 30 minutes to arrive, so I didn&amp;#39;t get home til 5.30am. And I had a shift at 11am the same morning! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took all my self-control and responsibility to not quit the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of us have been down and grumpy for the passed couple of weeks, due to a number of reasons. I work at a fairly busy restaurant, and weekends hit us hard, mostly due to the fact that our kitchen absolutely cannot keep up (we’re talking 45 mins for appetizers, an hour for entrees, etc), and because of this we are growing a customer base of people who think they can walk in and eat for free if they complain enough. This has been going on for a couple months now, and it’s been affecting our money badly.

I have a bad back but closing by myself for the last month screwed me up so bad that I couldn’t even get out of bed. My back feels like someone took a hammer to it when I’m still, but it’s even worse when I bend or twist. Has anyone used worker’s comp and how does it work? I messaged my boss about it and she’s making it seem like I need to file for disability and they’re not responsible. I know for a fact that all the sweeping, mopping, vacuuming, cleaning the BOH and re-setting it, and also all the large trays are what caused this. Thank you for any advice.&lt;/p&gt;

In case you don't know, the only thing the marker checks is the paper. US bills are made in a special cotton blend paper (which is why they survive your laundry cycle) and that is what the bill is detecting. But bills can be 'washed', which is when they bleach a low denomination bill and print a higher one on top. Your pen won't notice that.

So try to be very familiar with the security features on each denomination. You can find them online or your friendly banker can probably show you what to look for.

This lady is an uber driver, in her 70s? She was complaining about only getting a dollar tip, which from what I know, it takes a lot of effort to see if a specific rider tipped you. Her and this guy in his 50s start talking about how much she should get tipped. Which according to a google search was 10-20%. Which of course they said ""oh like a server!""

To which I said ""Well.. a lot of servers don't get 20% still. I was a server and have friends who are servers.""

So then they proceed to just start like, AGRESSIVELY asking where I was a server. I answered at a movie theater which I guess just completely invalidated my argument. 

This lady starts going off like ""Well you never see the server!"" And I try to explain that.. well yes you do, but she won't let me get a word in. Where I was a server, we went into the theater to take your order, we took payment, we ran the food, we gave refills, we did what a regular server would do but in an extremely dark room, up and down stairs. 

Anyways, I try to also add in I have friends that work in every type of resturant but they won't hear it, repeating that servers must! be tipped well!

Edit: She is also a bad uber driver in my opinion. She hangs around my job after accepting rides, making the person wait, plus she will accept rides, look where they are, then hope the rider cancels so she doesn't have to take them. Can't imagine what people who actually have her arrive deal with.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hi everyone! I work at a casual fast food pizza place. The kind where you build your pizza (Subway-style) and we cook it for you. One day about a month ago, I wasn't feeling too hot. I was exhausted, mentally and emotionally drained, and just came back after recovering from a sinus infection. I was in no mood to communicate with customers, so I hung by the oven to cook the pizzas. It was quieter, warm, and I could zone out for a bit while I waited for the food to cook.

A family of three came in, and it was a typical interaction, but my coworkers and I got a bit uncomfortable when the father gave his name. We take customers' names so we can call them when the food is ready, but instead of giving his actual name, the man said ""Baby Daddy."" 

Now this wasn't a HUGE deal, since at the time they were the only ones in the restaurant, and they were in a group, so we only needed to call out one of their names and hand all three pizzas off. We are also allowed to not call names if we aren't comfortable, can't pronounce them, etc. So we all agreed we weren't going to play along with this guy.

I was zoning out while waiting for my coworkers to finish building their pizzas so I could start cooking. The gentlman noticed this and said ""you can smile, you know. It's not against the law.""

I heard him talk, but since I was in my head, what he said didn't click. I gave him a quick smile and even laughed a bit, just to be polite, since he was looking right at me. ""There you go,"" he said, ""that's better."" I was confused. It didn't set in until a minute or two later what he actually said to me. I was even more confused and felt really uncomfortable. I wasn't feeling well as it was, and I'm not required to smile at customers unless I'm directly interacting with them. I told my boss what happened and he told me to let him know if he did or said anything else.

Luckily, that was the end of it. But when their pizzas were done, his DAUGHTER told my coworker to call out her father's name, since my coworker called out the daughter and mother's names. My coworker told her she wasn't comfortable with that, and the daughter got angry and walked away in a huff.

Overall, it was a weird, uncomfortable situation. Probably not the greatest story, but I still think about it a lot. It was my first experience with being told to smile, and my first experience being super uncomfortable while at work. They haven't come back since, thankfully, and my boss was supportive of how we handled everything.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Alright then, time to type this up and then get some much needed sleep. So, today was pretty interesting at my workplace, but before we delve into that, let's give you a bit of context, as of typing this, within the last 36 hours, I have gotten 2 hours of sleep, not even two consecutive hours, just two random hours split apart throughout the day. Anyway, I went to work at 5, feeling pretty drained, my contacts were being rejected by my eyeballs and it's cold as balls where I live; already a nice start. So, I clock in, get ready, look over my section and see someone already there, an elderly lady who was there since before I arrived, so I thought someone already got to her; about three minutes later, I see she still has a menu, no drink and the call server light on the TED (our little techy doohickies on the tables) was flashing. I walk over, ask if she's been helped already and in a pretty bitter tone, which I totally understand why, she says no, then instantly begins rattling off her order before I even bring out my pen and pad, barely scribbling it down and taking care of things; once she got her food, it went smoothly, so we're moving on. As I'm taking the lady's order, I see a pair get sat behind her, no biggie, once I'm at the POS typing in the food, I see that I got double sat, which is always peachy and given that my brain is running on 3% efficiency doesn't make it better. Anyway, I keep the best face I can, even using my tiredness to my advantage in the form of comedy, which I am so glad worked otherwise tips would not have turned out great. So, now that I've covered my first twenty minutes of work, let's get to the rest.

So, sometime around 6, somebody calls ahead to inform us that a 30 top is coming in, they don't know when, but they are coming, that was it; we don't do reservations, but we appreciate people calling ahead in order to accommodate, that is, when they give specific times. So, as soon as they hung up, our atrium, which houses most of our 6 tops has been closed to the public as a just in case measure because we have no clue when these people are going to show up, wanna know the best part about this? The only other big tops are located exclusively in my section; I'm pretty sure some of you know where this is going. Once the atrium was closed, there was really no need to be on a 7 server chart, so we cut down to 3 servers for the rest of the night, it was still only 6 o clock mind you, so that's pretty darn early. For the next hour and a half my section was like a hydra, I cashed out one table, two more took its place, well, not exactly like that, but it may as well have been, and oh god the sheer amount of 5-6 tops I had to serve just because our atrium was off limits. I moved non-stop for the majority of my shift, barely having time to even breathe because I just got triple sat with a two top and two other five tops; I couldn't buss any of my tables because I just had zero time to do so, I'm just glad the hosts decided to say screw the rules and helped out. (Apparently hosts can't buss tables anymore due to recent changes in the payroll, but some just say screw it because they're nice people, or they're bored.)

Around 7:15, the 30 top finally rolls around; their presence actually slowed down customer influx quite a bit, but not enough to get me to actually chill for a while, I was still in a constant state of motion, which again, given the fact I had barely slept is a miracle on its own. Now, that 30 top was about as loud as you probably imagined them being, their yells and laughs echoing throughout the restaurant, but something else accompanied them, their collective smell was basically a cloud of weed that I swear I was getting second-hand high from. I'm glad that I didn't get them since my buddy who did, racked up a 200+ bill and I don't think he actually got tipped by them, I feel really sorry for the guy since they were his only table for the hour and a half, nearly two hours they were there. Naturally, the atrium was still blocked off, so more people kept coming in and they kept seating me, almost ignoring the other section who only had about two tables in it while I was dealing with five. Little sidetrack, one of the tables I had did the basic ""fries are cold, can we get some new ones"" What surprised me the most about this is that the heat lamps in the back, for some unknown reason were cranked to the surface of the sun, making each plate unable to be grabbed without a hot pad and everyone was scavenging for one, so, another few things to add to the night. I wish I could say the night went smoothly after the 30 top left, but no, just no. Let's begin with, what I shall refer to as, table 52, since that's the number assigned to it.

Table 52 housed a mildly elderly couple, the husband looking either unimpressed or angry, so basic grumpy old man, while the wife seemed confused and scared for some odd reason. I did my usual routine, asking how they are, they asked me back after responding, I joked that I was pretty tired, but pushing through, but they just ignored me and went straight to asking for drinks, rude but alright. Now, I asked if they needed some more time, they said no, so I whipped out the pad and pen, only to wait around another two minutes while they independently asked questions and looked over the menu some more, which was great. They ordered quesadillas as an appetizer, then proceeded to order a combo meal that comes with two entrees as well as either an appetizer or two salads, they went with the salads, which I guess I could live with (salads make the ""first out"" button on our system go screwy, so we can't use it with them.) Lady asks for a Caesar salad with the dressing on the side, that's it, remember that now; husband goes for the house salad with ranch, pretty basic. They order their entrees, husband wants mushrooms on the side of his, easy to do; she doesn't want the garlic butter on the chicken and wants to replace the mashed potatoes with rice because of some diet I guess was the reason she told me? She was super quiet, so I couldn't quite hear, but I know it was about a diet. Anyway, I go to the system, pop in the quesadillas and the salads, hit send, then come back, put in one entree, begin to modify it, only to slam my head, quite audibly, against the computer out of frustration. I hate these computers because once you move on to another meal or send the order before finishing a combo, the entrees turn bold and make it incredibly hard to modify, either saying there's nothing there, or mashing every mod onto a totally different piece of food, so I said screw it, finished typing it all in, then had to go in the back and explain everything to the cook about 4 times before he finally got the gist. As I was helping to run food, lady from 52 comes right up and asks to have her chicken without any of the seasoning either, nearly three minutes after typing it in, so I go back and explain she wanted it without seasoning, effectively wasting a chicken breast. I run out their appetizers and she looks at her salad oddly, then proceeds to pick out the croutons, which was never specified once that she didn't want croutons, you all remember, it was only on side dressing; she doesn't tell me anything, just keeps picking them out. I walk by only seconds later to hear her say

""I can't eat this."" But she doesn't call me over, even though I am three feet away and nearly making eye contact. When I come back about five minutes later with their entrees, all she says is. ""That better not be our food."" Well sorry, it is, it's getting cold and I'm setting it down. I didn't actually say that, otherwise I wouldn't be coming back on Saturday. Anyway, what had happened was that she got the attention of the manager, completely under my radar and asked for a new salad without croutons, but she didn't specify dressing on the side, so she got it normally, with the dressing all over it, but no croutons, just like she asked. I walk by not two minutes later, she's eating the salad, looking like she's about to cry, then says to herself or her husband because her attention was nowhere near focused on me. ""Look at this, it's too saturated, there's no way I can eat this."" She then proceeds to fork another piece of salad into her mouth; I swear, it looked like eating that thing was causing her physical pain and I still don't get why she insisted on continuing to chow down on it when there was a perfectly good entree right next to her; if you don't like something, just set it aside and stop eating it, easy as that, we won't get offended if you do, but do everything she just did while my ""give a shit"" senses are offline due to no sleep, hell, do them even when they're online, you just look sad. I tried asking if everything else was alright, but I was just met with noises. After so many painful and awkward minutes, while still getting slammed in my section, they finally paid, the husband taking care of it and actually tipping to my surprise; I'm pretty sure that if she payed, I would have gotten a big fat 0 for a tip, at least it made up for table 41, who really seemed to like me, that left $1.98 on a $30 bill. I really hate it when people do that, act nice only to either stiff you or insult you with low money.

Now, let's get into late night, speaking of which, it's really late right now, I'm damn near falling asleep at my computer, so here's a checkpoint, I'll take care of the rest in the morning.

Or I guess I'm taking care of it nearly 24 hours later, well, that's beside the point. Anyway, when late night came around, the tables that occupied the 30 top were still dirty as there was a lot to clean up, so naturally, I was continuously getting hit with more and more big tops, pretty sure my seating multiplier reached quadruple sat range and most of them got done around the same time, wanting to cash out nearly simultaneously and two of them paying in $100 bills, for which I needed to go on a scavenger hunt for change, therefore wasting more time that could be used to check on tables or cash the others out. By this point, my brain was about as useful as a floppy disk is nowadays, so thank god I never let go of my pad, which had three pages of backlog on it to help me remember the existing tables, keep in mind that each page can fit up to 12 guests on it. I'm pretty sure the point in which I finally got a ""break"" was around 11:20, I had not eaten since around 3:30 and we closed at 1. When I finally got my food, I still couldn't just sit down and eat it in one sitting, I still had two existing tables and another two showed up before the night was over, so I did my usual shoveling of nutrients, gulping down soda, then rushing to my tables to see what they needed; the guy who takes down the expo line already did it and wrapped the condiments up by this time, so every time somebody asked, I had to waltz all the way to the cold box, unwrap the sauce/condiment and using one ramekin, scooping it into another, that was fun.

Once my final table left, I was the only server remaining since the other two were long gone by this time, it was around 1:20 and the only closing work I've done so far was refill my table caddies. I said screw it, grabbed the vacuum from the office, picked up any big trash, then vacuumed my section and around the bar, which is a part of my duties as well. I had to help out with whatever remaining dishes there were and only when that was done, did we finally lock down the restaurant and go home. My one saving grace was that my house was less than three minutes away, because I was in no condition to drive by the time this was over, yet I did. So, the moral of the story here is to get some damn sleep and if there's something wrong with your salad, address it directly to your server who already knows most of how you wanted it in the first place.",t2_2clxgui,False,,0,False,Sleep is Key (and a handful of other things),[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_f0ngcc,False,dark,,public,28,0,{},,0b6a7118-4e01-11e2-b1cf-12313d28169d,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,28,,False,self,False,standard,[],{},,True,,1581169967.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright then, time to type this up and then get some much needed sleep.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So this is from Togo, so I wasn't really a server at the time.

At the restaurant that I had worked had this one woman who came in every week always asking for the buffalo wings. She always asks for them to be extra crispy and to be slathered in sauce.

So a couple of weeks later and I start to think of this. I decided to test out my theory on her. This theory was that if she believed that her wings were seconds fresh instead of a minute or so, then she wouldn't call back. So her order did get ready before she came, but I kept it on the line and out of her view for a couple of minutes right before it started to melt the togo box. I bagged it and gave it to her.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Had a four table section. Things were going fine. A four top came and was sat at my last table, so I had a full section.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the gentleman is a pastor from another state. Every chance he had to tell me a corny dad joke, he took. I didn't really mind it the first or second time, but there came a point where it was really slowing down my ability to serve the other tables. He and his wife ordered just hot water and lemons. Once I brought them out, they proceeded to hold me hostage there with more jokes and distractions. It was getting seriously annoying. At one point, in the middle of ordering, I asked him how he wanted his burger cooked, to which he replied ""in the kitchen on a hot grill."" 

&amp;#x200B;

After all this, he had the nerve to tell me that the hot water wasn't hot enough. I brought him some more. The group also asked me during all this if I was single; they told me (with zero context, and i'm a male) that if my parents had kids, then the chances were high that I too would have kids. And finally, they asked me if I knew where I was going  after I die. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because my guests had all paid, I decided to entertain the conversation; I knew I probably wouldn't get a good tip, but I was past caring. I knew I had done my best to take care of them. Not only had they been very needy and distracting, now they were taking every chance to pry into my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I told them that nobody really knows where they will go. They assured me that they knew, because of what the Bible says. The rest of the discussion was civil and somewhat interesting, although I was seriously done with this table despite this. Mostly because they also informed me they'd be hanging out for a while. I got them to cash out and told them they could stay til close if they wanted (my job doesn't force us to stay for campers if it's the end of the shift or we're cut etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

When time came to pay, the pastor slipped some pamphlet in the check book with his and his wife's photo, with christian propaganda on it. After that, he left a $5 tip on a $40 check. Sure, I wasn't stiffed. But now I was fucking pissed because, not only did my other tables (of which I only had four the whole shift, because it was a slow lunch) tip me less because these assholes decided they were the only ones needing service; I now had just earned &lt;20% on a table I genuinely worked hard for and that forced me into uncomfortable conversations the whole time. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I entered the credit card tip into the system, I made sure to drop off the pamphlet back at the table.

Things were going fine. A four top came and was sat at my last table, so I had a full section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the gentleman is a pastor from another state. Every chance he had to tell me a corny dad joke, he took. I didn&amp;#39;t really mind it the first or second time, but there came a point where it was really slowing down my ability to serve the other tables. He and his wife ordered just hot water and lemons. Once I brought them out, they proceeded to hold me hostage there with more jokes and distractions. It was getting seriously annoying. At one point, in the middle of ordering, I asked him how he wanted his burger cooked, to which he replied &amp;quot;in the kitchen on a hot grill.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this, he had the nerve to tell me that the hot water wasn&amp;#39;t hot enough. I brought him some more. The group also asked me during all this if I was single; they told me (with zero context, and i&amp;#39;m a male) that if my parents had kids, then the chances were high that I too would have kids. And finally, they asked me if I knew where I was going  after I die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because my guests had all paid, I decided to entertain the conversation; I knew I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t get a good tip, but I was past caring. I knew I had done my best to take care of them. Not only had they been very needy and distracting, now they were taking every chance to pry into my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I told them that nobody really knows where they will go. They assured me that they knew, because of what the Bible says. The rest of the discussion was civil and somewhat interesting, although I was seriously done with this table despite this. Mostly because they also informed me they&amp;#39;d be hanging out for a while. I got them to cash out and told them they could stay til close if they wanted (my job doesn&amp;#39;t force us to stay for campers if it&amp;#39;s the end of the shift or we&amp;#39;re cut etc.). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When time came to pay, the pastor slipped some pamphlet in the check book with his and his wife&amp;#39;s photo, with christian propaganda on it. After that, he left a $5 tip on a $40 check. Sure, I wasn&amp;#39;t stiffed. But now I was fucking pissed because, not only did my other tables (of which I only had four the whole shift, because it was a slow lunch) tip me less because these assholes decided they were the only ones needing service; I now had just earned &amp;lt;20% on a table I genuinely worked hard for and that forced me into uncomfortable conversations the whole time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I entered the credit card tip into the system, I made sure to drop off the pamphlet back at the table.

I’m back at school now, but my manager asked if I was available for Valentine’s Day weekend a few weeks ago. I’m only an hour away from home/the restaurant so it wouldn’t be a huge deal for me to go home for the weekend to work, but me and my boyfriend had already started making plans for that weekend. After talking about it with him we decided that we could definitely use the extra money so I told my manager I was available.

I used to work as a server in a garden centre restaurant (I’m 17 I had nothing else to do). I’m not sure if they have there everywhere but in England it’s basically a plant shop with a cafe joined on.

,TalesFromYourServer,"What are some of the crazier scams, being in industry, that you have witnessed??? One scam that has stuck with me is below:

I have worked in the restaurant industry since I was 16 (basically 24 years). I started to manager full time about 8 years ago. Back when I served I had witnessed, what I thought, was every scam out there. Obviously I was very naive from when I started serving going into management because I realize the scammers only get more creative.

One that I will never forget:

I was the FOH manager and there was a GM.. we were the only managers for the restaurant. The GM wasn't the brightest guy. The only reason he was promoted was due to the previous GM getting fired and the owner wanted to bring someone in on a lower salary. From there I transferred to this location as the FOH manager.

One afternoon the GM was working and it wasn't very busy. Only a younger guy at the bar drinking. This guy has a $30 tab. When the guest was ready to pay his tab he asked the bartender if she could run his card for the $30 tab and add in a $100 tip. He said his Bank/ATM was too far away and he didn't want to drive that far. The guest offered to give the bartender $50 of the $100 tip and she would give him $50.

So the bartender obviously wanted to make this happen for the $50 tip. The bartender went to the GM (who was on the office) to explain the situation. The GM, without even giving it a second thought, said ok.
So the bartender runs tab. 

My shift started at 3pm. As soon as I walked in the door the bartender was so excited. And couldn't wait to tell me about the tip. She explained the story and I just shook my head. I looked at here and asked if she thought anything about this was off. She said No. I asked her what kind of card did he use. She said it looked like one of the pre paid AMEX cards.
 
I then explain how [we] were scammed by this guy she asked how. I explained that the guy probably only had enough to cover his tab. With Aloha the tips are usually added later. And even if entered right away it won't process though until the end of the night when the restaurant batches all transactions. 

This bartender was young and new to the industry so I wasn't really upset with her. She did the right thing by asking the GM. The GM should have known it was a scam. Or know that something was just off. 

The stupid thing about this was after I explained to the GM why it was a scam he still said I was wrong. I told him nothing about this makes sense. There are ATMs on every block some where. The GM response was that he had great instincts about people. I told him that this time his instincts were wrong. Keep in mind that the GM was the type of person that thinks they are right 100% of the time when in reality it's more like  the opposite and only right 20% of the time. I also told him we cannot give the bartender the other $50. He argued that he was the GM and once we swipe the card it has to be approved. That's when I explained the tips don't officially come out of an account until the end of the night.

Just to prove my point I called AMEX on speaker next to the GM. The only info I had was the last four of CC, guest name, and transaction. I gave this info to the rep. Explained what happened to the rep. The rep couldn't give me too much information but I asked if she could answer just one question:

Is there enough money in the account to cover the $30 + $100 tip and she said no. Then she said there is barely enough to cover the $30 tab. Even after this the GM tried to say it didn't matter it would over draft his account. The rep jumped in saying actually it won't. And it's likely none of the tab would be covered.

,TalesFromYourServer,"TLDR:  women were pissed there was a dog in the restaurant. They snarkily commented how itd better be a seeing eye dog. Spoiler, it is a seeing eye dog. They shut up



I was just reading a post on tales from the front desk about loud service dogs and thought of this situation. This was a few months ago and I was a hostess. 

We have this amazing regular who is almost blind. She comes in all the time and sits at the same seat at the bar. She brings her service dog a small blanket and it is so well behaved. 

I was seating these two women, mid30s possibly, at one of our booths in the bar area. They had requested a booth and this was the last one. Said here are the specials, your server is X, enjoy your dinner, bye. And I went on doing my thing. 

One comes storming up a few min later bc they noticed the dog and couldn't believe we would let an animal into our establishment and demanded to move bc the dog smelled (the dog didnt smell and also the entire restaurant smells like french fries or pizza, says the hungry always hostess). (Like you see those huffy customers from afar and wish the manager was closer so you didnt have to deal with it.) It was a pretty busy night ao the only table available now is a small two top on the other side of the restaurant. They take it. 

As we walk to the new table they say how it's so inappropriate to have a dog. I saw it is a service dog. They huff and think oh just another emotional support animal or something and one of them says, well that's ridiculous and that woman better be blind. They sit and I hand them the menus again and say, she is blind. And their mouths fell open and looked embarrassed and didn't cause any others problems.

&lt;p&gt;We have this amazing regular who is almost blind. She comes in all the time and sits at the same seat at the bar. She brings her service dog a small blanket and it is so well behaved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was seating these two women, mid30s possibly, at one of our booths in the bar area. They had requested a booth and this was the last one. Said here are the specials, your server is X, enjoy your dinner, bye. And I went on doing my thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One comes storming up a few min later bc they noticed the dog and couldn&amp;#39;t believe we would let an animal into our establishment and demanded to move bc the dog smelled (the dog didnt smell and also the entire restaurant smells like french fries or pizza, says the hungry always hostess). (Like you see those huffy customers from afar and wish the manager was closer so you didnt have to deal with it.) It was a pretty busy night ao the only table available now is a small two top on the other side of the restaurant. They take it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walk to the new table they say how it&amp;#39;s so inappropriate to have a dog. I saw it is a service dog. They huff and think oh just another emotional support animal or something and one of them says, well that&amp;#39;s ridiculous and that woman better be blind. They sit and I hand them the menus again and say, she is blind. And their mouths fell open and looked embarrassed and didn&amp;#39;t cause any others problems. And they tipped well in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"After graduating college, I went to the North Dakota oil fields to get a head start on paying my loans. I worked at a truck wash. It was not a pleasant job, but I quickly was making $18/hour, working 60+ hours a week ( sweet, sweet overtime pay), plus about $50/week on average in tips.

Since the oil tankers were driving on gravel and dirt roads to access the wells, they would constantly accumulate layers of dust over the whole rig. Because of this, it either took a lot of chemical (a combination of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and or hydrofluoric acid called Alumabrite) or scrubbing to remove it. It was cheaper to use the chemical since scrubbing to 3-4 times as long. The downside to the chemical is it removes any polish that is on the metal. To polish a trailer or that size, it would cost thousands of dollars. Therefore, we were very hesitant to use it on anything that still had a polish under all the dirt.

One day, a guy comes in with a trailer that is still polished. I ask if he wants us to just use soap, which would leave it still dull, scrub the whole thing, which would cost an extra $98 and extra hour, or use the acid on the trailer. He decides he wants just the soap, and assures me his trailer would look shiny again after that. 

We wash the truck as he ordered. He walks around and asks 

""How can we call this clean?. Why is there still dirt on his trailer?""

I finally get a chance to talk. ""Because it's hard and takes more time, it costs an extra $98. If you want to go and pay for the additional labor costs, we will gladly wash your truck. Is that what you want?""

,TalesFromYourServer,"Yesterday I was managing a shift during lunch with one of my servers. Her head count for the lunch shift was 30, which is a lot during a lunch shift with only one server.

We had one 3 too arrive. A woman in her 40's maybe and her two elderly parents. When they arrived there were many tables still in the restaurant finishing up. We have a big floor so it often appears the server isn't around, when in reality they are on the other side taking care of tables. That's where I come in.

I sat the table, watered them and got their drink order promptly. Made some conversation with them. Told them their server will be right with them. I went to the bar, got the drinks ready and handed them off the the server to get to the table. This took all of 5 minutes to get the drinks on the table. We don't have a bartender, busser or anyone else. Just me and the server.

The server was there and tried to take their order but they took quite some time to get their order in. Now this server is new to serving. She doesn't have the years of experience some of the other servers have, only months. And doing a lunch shift is a lot for her, but what she lacks I pick up for her while training her how to prioritize and handle matters appropriately when she is the only one on the floor.

Their order was oddly specific. The two mom and daughter got bowls of soup and calamari to share as their entrees. The father got an actual entree and a salad that comes with it. They requested everything to be brought out at the same time. The server communicated with me that this is how they wanted everything and I did hear them order it that way as well. So she did everything she was supposed to do correctly.

The dishes are ready, I put them in the tray in the kitchen and hand them off to the server. She brings them out and everything is fine. She returns to the table and they say everything is fine. We'll, while I was setting another table nearby they call me over and tell me one of the soups is too thick and the other soup taste burnt. Fine. I ask if they would like us to remake them. They say no. They are rude and giving me dirty looks, which they were doing from the moment they walked in the door. I start telling them about our 3rd soup we have and offer them a taste of it to see if they would like to have that one since they don't want us to remake the soups they chose. They agree. I go to the kitchen, ladle up a sample for them and take it out. Now, one of the woman agreed to taste and the other didn't. When I asked she said no. So I only brought one sample. And of course the woman who told me she didn't want a sample grabbed it out of her mom's hand and complained to me about how I didn't bring her one. Fine, whatever. They agree to the new soups. When I was in the kitchen the soup de jour was low so I told them to make a new one asap. Went back into the kitchen to tell them they were ordering two new soups (soup tickets don't go to the kitchen since servers grab it for themselves) and told them to rush it.

The kitchen has no sense of urgency when it comes to soups. They are constantly messing up the consistency of all 3 soups because they don't pay attention. And when the servers tell them it's wrong they give major attitude and don't fix it promptly. It's completely embarrassing that we can't manage to bring soups in a timely manner or at the right consistency. But this is an ongoing issue that's been happening for as long as I have worked there and it's never been addressed.

The owner was there and she specifically insinuated that I am not to comp their soups for them. She is very finicky about making sure that there are no losses. Any other restaurant I've worked at I would have had that luxury. However, where I am now it's not a thing we do. Even when sometimes it is on us.

I tried being polite and making conversation with the table, watering them. My presence on them was overbearing for them but I was getting shit from the owner to keep my presence there. Which in turn just ended up making the server look bad.

They acted like everything was fine and then went home and wrote a horrible, lengthy email full of lies. Claiming it took the server forever to get to their table. Claiming the place was empty. Even though it was the 3 o'clock lull and it wasn't actually empty. Claiming all of their food was cold even though they took forever to eat it. Turtle pace. Claiming it took forever to get the order in but other tables received their food before them. Probably because they were there before them and didn't take 15 minutes to choose. Claiming it took me 10/15 to bring them a sample and then that it took me 10/15 to bring the soups our after they reordered. Made a crack at me for asking them if they were form the area. Which I was doing to make conversation because we have a frequent diner program and we also get a lot of travelers because of our location. But in the email she suggested that I was suggesting that something was wrong with them not liking the soups because they aren't from around the area. Meanwhile I was just trying be personable. Suggested the soup was frozen and then we had to microwave it and that's why it took so long. Everything we make from scratch and we don't microwave a single thing unless a customer specifically requests it, which is normally only a cup of coffee because they prefer it piping hot. Saying their server was horrible and gave bad service. There's so much more, I can keep going.

Anyways, the owner got the email and forwarded it to me and the server and now we need to go in early today to talk to her about it. She's PISSED. But in reality, this whole thing is the kitchens fault. We both did everything we could. If the kitchen could manage to get the soups right for once this would have happened. If they bothered to get the new soup prepared in time they wouldn't have had to wait. There would have been no problems. With people like these people, one thing goes wrong and suddenly everything becomes questionable and they start twisting everything into a much worse scenario than it is.

Fed up with the kitchens lack of urgency in regards to this sort of thing. I plan on fighting this email with the owner, yelling her about how this woman completely lied.

Tonight was a slower night so service was super smooth. Near the end of my shift I have the (dis)pleasure of serving an older gentleman and his friend, and aside from some dietary restrictions, it's pretty uneventful. 

They finish their mains, I clear &amp; wipe the table, and drop off a dessert menu. They're chatting away, so I leave them for a while; there's no rush tonight, and I can keep busy with sidework any way. 

I stop by to check on them and see if any desserts have caught their attention. This was my mistake apparently, because the older gentleman decides it's his opportunity to go on a condescending tangent.

It's all about how he teaches at the nearby college in the culinary program that's on par with Michelin star restaurants. (Um cool? I don't care).

,TalesFromYourServer,"For the last year, I’ve been waiting tables at a little family-owned noodle place near a college campus. It’s great. There are a lot of super nice regulars, management is fantastic, the chef is a very sweet old guy who is absolutely militant about making sure I am fed. It’s a generally sweet gig that I am infinitely grateful for.

There are only ever three or MAYBE four people in the restaurant at a time: a waiter, the manager, the chef, and occasionally a secondary cook. The chef and manager are father and son, respectively, and they’re just. Adorable. Heartwarming. Fantastic.

Today I came in to work and found out that a secondary cook that I worked a lot of my shifts with (I’ll call him Jack) was fired over the weekend for badmouthing the Chef to...the manager. The chef’s son. The more the manager told me about the situation, the stupider it seemed, and tbh I just glazed over a lot of it. But in the course of this conversation, the manager and I got to talking about Jack in general, and it went something like this:

Manager (M): Well, if there’s one thing I can say about Jack, it’s that he was never late [makes face that indicates he’s about to spill some hot tea]...but do you know WHY he was never late?

Me (C): No...? Why would I?

M: *Well* did you know that he was always scheduled to come in to work at 5:30?

C: ????No, he always came at 4:30, half an hour before the end of my shift????

M: Yeah, he always came in an hour early just to see you

C: Why would he do that?

(I am a big, big dumbass)

M: Because he had a crush on you! The first day you came in, and he saw you, he came to me and he said, “Hey, Manager, you think I can get with her?” And I told him I didn’t know, it was up to you. And then you didn’t notice him at all, so finally I had to tell him that it just didn’t seem like you were interested. 

C: Eh, weird, he never said anything to me

M: Remember how he was always trying to talk to you about his car?

C: Was that flirting? Blegh, I just thought he was really into cars.

And then things kind of digressed from there. I never, EVER picked up on the fact that Jack had any interest in me, and if I had picked up on it, I definitely wouldn’t have reciprocated. I always thought our relationship was...y’know...congenial, but professional. But now I feel weird about all of my previous interactions with him, and on top of everything else to know that he was coming in *an hour early* just to hang around me. Icky.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Okay so I've posted before a out being short staffed and it seems to have reached its breaking point.

Our regional manager brought someone in from another location to. ""Clean things up"" our location is already very clean and we follow procedure to a t.

Well I come in at 4. Notice people in the lobby waiting on orders are very agitated. I ask our gm what's going on, and she says that the lady from the other location (I'll refer to her as OLL from now on) is dropping meat fresh for every order, and making one burger/sandwich at a time. 

We usually have 2 full trays of each meat so the maximum it normally takes to get your meal is 5 minutes if we're waiting on fried or 6 if we're waiting on chicken. So little to no wait normally. 

The past two hours have been absolute hell. People waiting 30 minutes for one cheeseburger since shes doing orders one at a time, and dropping meat for each one.

Customers have been livid. 
Been asked to do several refunds and then OLL gets mad at me when I tell her it was because of the wait time. 

A few of the most notable over theadt few hours:

Guy comes in orders a cheese curd and a fry. Shes also dropping fries for each individual order. Shes going down the screen order by order doesn't matter if it's just a pretzel or a fry, it waits for its turn in the screen. So this guy waited 15 minutes for a cheese curd and fry. This man is screaming and yelling. I eventually promo it off 

There have been a ton of comped meals and free sundae coupons given out 

Lady at drive orders 6 six piece baskets. We let her know it's going to be about 10 minutes on chicken. OLL fries each six piece separately. It took this woman 30 minutes to get all her chicken. We had her pulled up and when I went to take it out she said she was about to come in because she thought we forgot about her. 

I'm sure there'll be more because OLL is here with us all night.

I think everyone is at their wits end. GM is talking about quitting and everyone else said if she quits they do.

I can't I can't afford to even as much as I like her so I'm at a loss about what to do.

UPDATE:

She finally left. The rest of the night ran a bit smoother, most of it was ice cream, but if there was food ordered people still waiting 10-15 minutes on it. 

GM told me that shes only here until sunday but everyone plans on quitting saturday as a Fyou to the regional manager. I'm very worried. This will only leave me and two other people working here. I do not have the option of quitting, I need the paycheck. This is not enough to keep the location staffed even during one shift let alone all day.

Backstory, my wife and I had our favorite restaurant that we frequented a lot (at least once a week) so we got to know everyone working there pretty well and became close friends with a few of the servers and the manager.  

One of our friends was working that night as and approached us to help him out.  He said he got complaints from a couple of servers about tips completely missing (e.g. $0 on a $100 bill from regulars that always tip).  He was suspecting that it the busboy doing it but had no proof.  We were sitting across from a table that was just finishing up, so our friend waited until they were gone and replaced the tip with like $10-$15 of his own (the actual tip was much larger) and left the check holder on the table.  He then asked us to just keep an eye on the table when the busboy came by and report back to him.  

Well as we watched he cleared the table, put the check holder in his apron and disappeared around the corner to a hidden section of the restaurant and returned a minute later to replace the holder to the now clean table.  Our friend came by and as expected the holder was empty.  We then relayed what we saw (busboy taking the holder, disppearing, etc.).  I remember seeing him slump visibly and walk off like he knew the truth but didn't want it to be so.

We talked later with our friend and he along with the manager confronted the busboy on what happened and gave him the chance to confess and be fired with no further actions taken.  He owned up to it and was escorted out.  Everyone working there was kind of bummed (even despite getting their tips stolen) because it was a small family owned type place and the owner had taken a chance on hiring the kid. Everyone really liked him and he'd had some troubles earlier on in life  and was trying to turn things around (he was only like 18-19 at the time) but couldn't seem to get out of his own way.

I had two reactions to this, the first was the complete /r/UnethicalLifeProTips/ route of why in the world are you the taking the whole tip?  Skim a few bucks here and there, you may not get caught (at least for awhile)  but you take the WHOLE DAMN TIP?

Our POS is set up so that you can ring in ""open items"" and the price can be anything but zero. Sometimes when the bar is busy it's a bad idea to call for a taster, better to send a ticket. So I send through a ticket and charge one cent.

,TalesFromYourServer,"For almost eight years, I worked at a popular U.S. chain restaurant that specializes in breakfast food. I won't go into specifics but they may or may not heavily feature various flavors of pancakes.

Over time, several managers came and went but the one who stuck around was the ladder-climbing, brown-nosing GM: a narcissistic, verbally abusive, control freak *Mommie Dearest* knock-off.  She had a way of making “please and thank you” sound like “Fuck you.”  Among her countless annoying attributes included: breathing, slandering others to guests and staff alike, she while delivering an ~~instruction~~ order, wouldn't allow me to respond then conclude the interaction with “Mmmkay? Mmmkay” which was almost always followed by an annoying Crypt Keeper cackle.

Funny story. One Christmas, I was unlucky enough to draw her name for The Secret Santa gift exchange. I seriously considered buying her a batch of wire hangers with the card simply saying “no wire hangers ever.”

I was one of those “highly valued” employees, but the way I was treated completely belied the compliments and accolades I received i.e. my schedule being flipped without my consent, day off requests being denied while new employees and the GM's drinking buddies got preferential treatment, *always* taking the side of the guest when they were angling for a free meal, etc. 

Perhaps the worst was the bullying and pettiness among certain employees. It was like high school.  For example, another employee poked me in the face with a tampon right in front of both managers. I filed an official complaint and *nothing* came of it. This is one such occasion where they couldn't claim ignorance. My complaint made it real and they *had* to address it. Address it, they did. They saw me as a whistle blower.  Management couldn't have cared less about staff morale. It was typical of both of those embittered hags to accept hearsay as fact. They rarely did their diligence in getting both sides before plotting a course of action. Oh, and plot they did. Most of the time they would take the word of the so-called “customer” or the server passing on the “complaint.” The complaint itself, of course, was completely fabricated. No such customer existed and it was really a coworker just trying to stir the pot. Unfortunately, the following shows they responded to my complaint to workplace bullying with malicious intent.

This whole shit show came to a head when, a cokehead now-former employee circulated a rumor that, I refused to wait on this elderly African American military veteran because I was a “racist.” Being one myself, I respect *all* veterans. I found it alarmingly laughable, at best, because: 1) I am a *very* gay man and 2) most of my boyfriends haven't been white. Hell, everyone *including* management met my Brazilian then-boyfriend when he had previously popped in for Sunday brunch. So, you can understand why this accusation was out of character and completely out of the blue. It reeked of sabotage. It was too outlandish to be anything else.

So, the write-up came. I was absolutely furious as my suspicions that I was being setup had been confirmed. Both the narcissistic GM and the drunken assistant manager would not let me get a word in. I finally got their attention by stating, in a raised voice, that I had a right to have my say. Surprised at my assertiveness, they went slit-eyed and rather smugly said, “Go on.”

I pointed out to them that all of my guests love me. Several of my regulars are Hispanic or African American and, in nearly eight years of employment, *never* once had I been accused of being prejudiced or bigoted. I also pointed out that one of my regulars, a married female African American doctor, if my hands were free, would run up to me give me a big hug, kiss me on the cheek and hold me so tight I felt like I was being suffocated. My managers were having none of it.

I also pointed out that the shit-starting liar who filed the complaint against me had been fired because she was caught *by the GM* snorting cocaine in the ladies room. Given her predisposition to lie, the validity of her accusation should be questioned and the write up destroyed. Based off of their surprised expressions, it was clear I had exposed their complicitness in creating a hostile work environment, but they refused to take the bait.

Completely done with their fuckery, I flat out bellowed: “I am *not* nor have I ever been a racist!”  I'm pretty sure the entire store heard me.
Then I went for the zinger that lingers: 

“You have *no* idea how much black dick has been in me.” 

You could have heard a pin drop. The Creole prep cook was walking by the office door when I let out that line and she nearly doubled over with laughter. There were two training managers facing away from us while they were on the computer doing online courses. They almost collapsed onto the keyboard then turned around looking at me with shocked expressions on their faces.  The assistant manager’s face went beet red. The GM’s face turned white and her eyes widened.

I didn't give them a chance to respond. I said: “You know what?” I took off my key fob, laid it on the safe, emptied my apron, put everything in a togo bag, did an about face and walked out. It was exhilarating and liberating all at the same time. It was like the end of *Private Benjamin*, when Goldie Hawn walked out of her wedding and threw away her veil, except I've never worn a dress. Just kidding. Yes, I have.

Aside from returning two weeks later to get my final paycheck, I haven't set foot in there. I have no reason to back. 

I have a new job at a wonderful company with great bosses that value me as an employee and as a person. I *actually* look forward to going to work now. I never thought that was possible. Double-plus: they don't expect me to be an emotionless robot.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I have never worked at a place with so many regulars. 
Often there are 7 or 8 tables in the restaurant that we are all on a first name basis with. 
Well, I am because I remember names but we all know them. (Coffee guy, Kathys boyfriend, iced tea and Diet Coke couple and so on). 
Anyways, today Ellen came in. She usually comes in with her husband Ronald but he’s been struggling with his health since he broke his ankle in early winter. She’s come in with her adult kids recently, but not Ronald.


When she came in today I wasn’t busy at all so I asked her about Ronald. 
Cue her immediate tears.
You guys. Just yesterday this woman had to put her husband of 57 years (their anniversary is Saturday) in a long term care facility because he is just too much for her to take care of. And she’s been taking care of him full time since 2013- and fought breast cancer twice in the meantime. 
So I sat down with her and just let her talk about it. 
She’s sad because she feels like she let him down (she didn’t) she misses him, she feels like she is doing him wrong. 


I told her that at 75 years old (and she’s 100 pounds soaking wet) that she has to do what’s best for her and him. Then I bought her breakfast and wrote her a note telling her she was wonderful.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hi all, 

Context: I am a waitress in a hotel in Australia. We are paid hourly and tipping is not customary. We rely very heavily on employers to do the right thing. 

Legally, and according to our workplace regulations, we must have a break 5.5 hours into our shift. Any time worked past this 5.5 hour deadline without a break adds an increase onto our hourly rate. 

Managers will always adjust our time sheets to have our breaks 5.5 hours into the shift, even if we didn’t go on break at that time or didn’t have a break at all.  

I know it is not always realistic to have your break within this deadline. However, they are really taking advantage of us because it happens often and we are never compensated. I have probably never received an accurate payslip. It isn’t a huge amount of money but it’s still upsetting that they really don’t care about us, only their targets and KPIs. 

I have reason to believe that the general manager of the hotel is aware, as well as all subordinates who run the various food outlets in the hotel. 

Can I go against them? I want to make a stand but don’t know how and if I even should.  

Interesting note: An executive at my workplace was a floor manager at a certain Australian fine dining chain that currently are being investigated for wage theft of 10! MILLION! DOLLARS!!!!

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’ve worked as a server at a large casino in the Midwest for a number of years now. It is on “sovereign land” or whatever so I know there’s not a lot of federal rights. Or so they say. 

When I first started, they trained servers in one specific venue and that’s it. You were not allowed to work in another restaurant inside the casino, unless you were fully transferring. 

Fast forward to last year- we are now ALL required to work at least 1 shift in another venue, very often being scheduled outside of our availability. On top of that, there are banquets that used to be optional. They would set up a time sheet and allow people to fill in if they wanted extra shifts. 

Eventually the banquet section at the casino got incredibly busy (there are 6 banquet rooms, with one main room used mainly for concerts, but can be broken down into 3 more banquet halls). The banquet staff was not adequately staffed, so they started adding servers in restaurants to the banquet schedule. 

The main reason this is an issue for me, and many others is that they always schedule outside of availability (my restaurant is open from 5pm to 10pm, yet they schedule me for a 5 am banquet? Fuck you). AND on top of that, there is no set wage. We have absolutely no idea what we’re going to be getting paid until we get our check stubs on pay day. Some times it’s great, work 8 hours and get an extra $200 on your check. But very, very often this is not the case. Most recently I worked a party for guests of the casino who had won a certain amount of money in the last month. I worked 6 hours and received a $40 service charge on my check.

I then ask “Would you like a couple more minutes?” Which she of course responds with “You see I have an allergy to citrus and have no idea what dressings have citrus and which ones don’t.”

Then my supervisor turns the corner and I recruit her help, to which she stands there at this table for 15 minutes and comes back to me with an order: Two of our most popular dishes, with absolutely no modifications.

&lt;p&gt;I then ask “Would you like a couple more minutes?” Which she of course responds with “You see I have an allergy to citrus and have no idea what dressings have citrus and which ones don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my supervisor turns the corner and I recruit her help, to which she stands there at this table for 15 minutes and comes back to me with an order: Two of our most popular dishes, with absolutely no modifications. The citrus woman actually ordered what I had recommended so I guess she just loves talking in circles for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t hold your servers at the table for extended periods of time. We don’t have time for it&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work at an expensive pizza place known for our Chicago deep dish in California, and this happened on Saturday, which got pretty busy. I was walking away from taking two table's orders, after which I was planning on grabbing waters and greeting a new table that had sat down maybe 3 minutes before.Since our restaurant is pretty small, when it gets busy it gets super loud, plus we have a full bar so the customers drinking get pretty loud as well. 

As I'm walking back to input the orders, the father from my new table flags me down as I walk past him and asks who their waiter is. It's a party of three, a mom, dad, and daughter who looked about 16. I look at their table and see he has his phone timer on facing me, thankfully the timer was at 2 minutes, but I could tell they were going to be a fun party. 

Father: F

Mother: M

Me: I'm actually your server tonight, would you like me to take your order now? 

F: Yes, I would like a small cheese pizza

Me: Great, would you like thin crust or deep dish?

F: Thin crust

Me: Okay, and for you? (to the mother)

M: I want gluten free and vegan

Me: Okay, we have a gluten free crust that's the same size as the small thin crust and a vegan cheese option, would you like any toppings on that?

M: What comes on it?

Me: Well you can choose any of our specialty pizzas or you can build your own with any of the toppings on this list (pointing to the list on the menu).

M: But what already comes on it?

Me: So far I just have vegan cheese on it, would you like just cheese on the pizza?

M: Well I don't know, what toppings come on the vegan cheese? 

Me: The vegan cheese is just the replacement we use if you want vegan cheese, it doesn't include any toppings. You can choose any of these toppings or one of our specialty pizzas.

M: Oh, so I choose toppings that you add to the pizza?

Me: Yes! (I still have two tables' orders to put in and this conversation has been going on for at least five minutes)

M: okay, what vegetables are vegan?

I'm not even joking, she didn't say what TOPPINGS are vegan, she said VEGETABLES!! I had just gotten back from a table that thought it was funny to mess with me all night (the salad was too small HAHA just kidding, acting offended when I asked if they wanted anything else tonight before handing them the check, etc) so I just stood there and smiled at this lady.

F: Did you just hear yourself? You asked what vegetables are vegan, that doesn't make sense. She's asking what toppings you want!

M: Oh hahaha okay. I will get pepperoni. 

I say nothing about the lack of veganness in pepperoni, I am tired and I am not going to repeat this whole thing. 

Me: Wonderful! Anything else for you guys?

F: She (the teenage daughter) will have the kids cheese pizza. Actually pepperoni. With bacon. Only bacon actually. Maybe pepperoni and bacon. Actually, no bacon, sorry daughter, maybe next time. 

I read back their order, starting with the thin crust the father ordered. 

F: Thin crust??? I wanted thick crust! I wouldn't come here for thin crust, I always get thick crust everywhere! 

Me: Oh I'm sorry, deep dish. (I clarify deep dish and not thick crust because those are two different crusts and I don't want this man expecting a fluffy pizza and getting a deep dish... which is not at all fluffy or has a thick crust.) That's cool that you're able to find other good deep dish pizzas, I haven't seen another pizza place in the area with deep dish. (I'm genuinely just trying to be friendly, Chicago deep dish is very uncommon in my area.

He just stares at me and looks slightly mad that I corrected him from thick crust to deep dish, and that I commented on how he only eats deep dish apparently.

I finish up with them and put their order in, they leave me a 15% tip so that's good, but it was just so weird how bad they were at ordering, plus timing me to see how long it took to greet them was not cool.

I was walking away from taking two table&amp;#39;s orders, after which I was planning on grabbing waters and greeting a new table that had sat down maybe 3 minutes before.Since our restaurant is pretty small, when it gets busy it gets super loud, plus we have a full bar so the customers drinking get pretty loud as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;m walking back to input the orders, the father from my new table flags me down as I walk past him and asks who their waiter is. It&amp;#39;s a party of three, a mom, dad, and daughter who looked about 16. I look at their table and see he has his phone timer on facing me, thankfully the timer was at 2 minutes, but I could tell they were going to be a fun party. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father: F&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother: M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m actually your server tonight, would you like me to take your order now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F: Yes, I would like a small cheese pizza&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Great, would you like thin crust or deep dish?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F: Thin crust&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, and for you? (to the mother)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: I want gluten free and vegan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, we have a gluten free crust that&amp;#39;s the same size as the small thin crust and a vegan cheese option, would you like any toppings on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: What comes on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Well you can choose any of our specialty pizzas or you can build your own with any of the toppings on this list (pointing to the list on the menu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: But what already comes on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: So far I just have vegan cheese on it, would you like just cheese on the pizza?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: Well I don&amp;#39;t know, what toppings come on the vegan cheese? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: The vegan cheese is just the replacement we use if you want vegan cheese, it doesn&amp;#39;t include any toppings. You can choose any of these toppings or one of our specialty pizzas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: Oh, so I choose toppings that you add to the pizza?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes! (I still have two tables&amp;#39; orders to put in and this conversation has been going on for at least five minutes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: okay, what vegetables are vegan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even joking, she didn&amp;#39;t say what TOPPINGS are vegan, she said VEGETABLES!! I had just gotten back from a table that thought it was funny to mess with me all night (the salad was too small HAHA just kidding, acting offended when I asked if they wanted anything else tonight before handing them the check, etc) so I just stood there and smiled at this lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F: Did you just hear yourself? You asked what vegetables are vegan, that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. She&amp;#39;s asking what toppings you want!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: Oh hahaha okay. I will get pepperoni. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say nothing about the lack of veganness in pepperoni, I am tired and I am not going to repeat this whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Wonderful! Anything else for you guys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F: She (the teenage daughter) will have the kids cheese pizza. Actually pepperoni. With bacon. Only bacon actually. Maybe pepperoni and bacon. Actually, no bacon, sorry daughter, maybe next time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read back their order, starting with the thin crust the father ordered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F: Thin crust??? I wanted thick crust! I wouldn&amp;#39;t come here for thin crust, I always get thick crust everywhere! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Oh I&amp;#39;m sorry, deep dish. (I clarify deep dish and not thick crust because those are two different crusts and I don&amp;#39;t want this man expecting a fluffy pizza and getting a deep dish... which is not at all fluffy or has a thick crust.) That&amp;#39;s cool that you&amp;#39;re able to find other good deep dish pizzas, I haven&amp;#39;t seen another pizza place in the area with deep dish. (I&amp;#39;m genuinely just trying to be friendly, Chicago deep dish is very uncommon in my area.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I spent a few minutes posting this on a local FB industry page. Decided halfway through that it would fit better here. 

Story time. I’ll make this as short as possible. 

I worked in a bar/restaurant that had men’s, woman’s rooms as well as a “handicapped” bathroom. 

One time, during happy hour (the place was in the financial district so it was mainly lunch and happy hour - Next to no one in there after 8pm) a woman and two men came in. I was working service well (300 seat restaurant, so pretty busy) and the first two seats at the 40 seat bar. 

Anyway, these people were great!  Understanding that I’m serving nearly the whole restaurant, had their orders and cc ready. They were drinking, but didn’t seem excessive - but the woman was less than half the size of both men. So maybe the beers hit her harder. 

Anyway, about an hour and a half in, the men kinda flag me down. I’m still in the shits, but they’ve been great, so I give them priority. I ask what’s up. 

Turns out that one of the men is the woman’s boyfriend. She had gone to the bathroom a long time earlier, and BF was worried. He wanted me to go I to the restroom and check on her. Totally fair. 

I told my cohort that I was disappearing for a minute, and he covered me. I went into the ladies room and nothing. It was getting late so literally, no one was in there except for the older woman washing her hands. I kicked doors in. 

So, obviously, GF must be in the handicapped bathroom, right?  Probably puking, poor thing. I check on my fellow bartender to make sure he’s fine, and maybe he knows where the key to the bathroom is? He has no clue and is fine. So I knock on the door for the second time. Give it some space, then knock again. 3 times. Music is loud, but not that loud. I assume she is passed out and something could be going badly for her!!  I go into a deep dive for the key. 


Still can’t find the key. But then, I put two and two together. None of those bar bathroom keys need an actual key. 

So I grab a mailbox key (or whatever) and shove it into the lock. The boyfriend and friend were standing behind me. The door opens and...

Working seven days a week had been and still is a pain in the ass, yet I managed to quickly get up on my feet and get the job done. Only today's event at the restaurant did not go well for me...

A lady walked into the restaurant and asked me to seat her at a booth while she waits for her brother to arrive. Once I've given her a booth, she left her coat on the bench and told me she will be going to the washroom (bathroom) and return momentarily.

I didn't have the energy to speak, so I nodded in response. I went back to my podium in case customers arrive at the entrance. I did my job -- bussed and wiped tables, set up cutleries, grabbed a pile of menus to put back at the front, greeted and sat customers, etc.

A few minutes or so, a man -- Caucasian, half bald, big and probably was in his mid-50s or 60s -- arrived at the entrance.

""How can I help you today, sir?"" I politely inquired.

""My sister is here."" When he said that, I immediately remembered the woman I sat earlier, who still hasn't come back from the washroom.

""Oh sir, I think I know who you are talking about. Your sister is in the washroom right now. I'll show you where she will be sitting.""

""Where did my sister go?""

""In the washroom, sir,"" I repeated.

And the most despicable thing I've ever heard from this ignorant man was:

""*I* need to go to the washroom because I have SARS on my hands,"" he showed me his huge hands and asked, ""Would you like me to give you some SARS? I have them on my hands. I need to wash them, quick!"" He chuckled as if it was funny to him.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hello I've recently come across this subreddit and wanted to share a relatable story about a customer. I've posted this on r/talesfromretail and I thought it would fit here as story.
For context, I work at my campus coffee shop. At this shop we are licensed to sell brand named coffee and as a result we are always having drink rushes. Some items our coffee shop sells have no set price in the register systems. This means we have to manually put them in. We usually have chill level headed customers. 

I've never came arcoss a ""Karen"" before (Althoughmy grandma was a sweet Karen). During a drink rush my awesome coworkers ask the people behind the person at the register their drink order. One person was behind someone at the register. We'll call her Karen, who was an older woman who looked tired. This was probably because finals week occurring at this time. She mumbled her order trying to avoid speaking too much. After I rung up the person right in front of her, she moved forward. I put on my charming energetic customer service extension of my personality to get her order.
 
When I asked what she wanted she said someone took her order, and I say ""I need to make sure I know what to charge you for"". She says her drink is a latte. I charge for a latte which is 3.85 plus tax and cost 4.22 as a result. She then grabs a biscuit cookie and ask to have that added to her order. I input the item as 1.95 per instructions given. Her order totals out to be 6.17. Just as she sees and here's the price she immediately disagrees. She then asks ""Why's it so expensive shouldn't it be five dollars"". I respond ""Yeah, but it's been taxed"". Almost immediately, she complained that she doesn't understand why it's so much for coffee. All the while I'm thinking she is having a hard time understanding math and sales tax. My Awesome coworker comes over and tries her best to fix the situation. We remove the biscuit cookie and reenter the price. To my amazement she still wasn't satisfied. I explained ""The cookie is 1.95 added to your order makes it 6.17.""

 She responds with "" Wasn't the coffee 3.85 why is it 6.17"". Her order without tax was 5.80. The tax was 0.37 not a lot in terms of what she got. After we explained it to her she changes her mind saying ""I'm just gonna go to the cafeteria, this too expensive"". She then walks away to her next plan of action. As she left my thoughts were the price is gonna be the same for the latte minus the cookie.
 My badass coworker says when she's not in earshot ""The price is going to be the same regardless"". My two coworkers and I decide on what to do with the already made latte. I tell my badass coworker to take it to a friend I say in the library. She then went and gave it, I waved to them. The day ended without a hitch and my shift was great. I later found out that Karen is a regular customer who often gives the staff I work with trouble. So I doubt I could have helped if I tried because it would been too expensive.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I used to work at a dog-friendly patio restaurant that serves pizza and sandwiches. It’s a small, cozy little spot in a neighborhood, good for lunch breaks from work and evening drinks to catch up with friends. 


The afternoon between however, is ALMOST ALWAYS dead between those two times. Needless to say, with a small restaurant and light and trimmed staff, the dead zone was usually ran by the owner... who was and probably still is a massive asshole.  He took over around 1:30, cutting all the servers and bartenders when it slowed down. Except for one. That server left when the last table was gone, meaning you could leave if none else came in after your table left at 2, OR you could be stuck till past when the night shift came in if you had campers.  


I liked the extra money, so I never really complained about staying after, with only one exception, which is where this story begins.


It was a fairly busy lunch shift that went smoothly. No mess ups whatsoever, decent tips were made and it was time to decide who got cut. Like I said, I usually didn’t mind being last cut, other than it meant working with the Owner (O- from here on out) which is always stressful. He knew nothing about the Service Industry or food in general, but insisted he did and usually got in the way, messing things up then blaming us (or me, in this story) for the mistakes. His manic, aggressive energy alone could ruin a whole shift. 


The two girls that were first cut began their shift sidework and I kept buzzing around my last few tables: A couple, late 20’s, early 30’s, an older gentleman and his son (regulars whom I love), a small family, and outside on the patio was a lady and her tiny terrier mix puppy. Not a stressful set of people. 


I was a well oiled machine, getting things in place efficiently in my own time and way... everything was timed out perfectly to dovetail. Then I walk in to the window to see O rearranging and grabbing food before I could stop him. 


Me: Hey! O! I got it! Those don’t— 

O: Well OBVIOUSLY you don’t! GOD do I have to hold your hand?! 


He took out things in the wrong order from how the young couple wanted it. He brought things the Dad and Son didn’t need and were confused because they specifically SAID they didn’t need it, they never do.  O gets flustered easily (not good for someone in the service industry) and began yelling at me LOUDLY, in front of customers, blaming it all on me. I didn’t even argue.


I grabbed the order for the lady on the patio and took it out, asked if she needed anything else. She didn’t, but her dog escaped her lap and followed me to the door. He’s not allowed inside so I stopped him gently and herded him back to his mama.


Wrong move, I guess.


O: (from across our small restaurant, in front of all our customers, LOUDLY) WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE! You have people in here waiting for you (they weren’t) and you’re out there fucking around with a dog?! 

Me:(rushing back to keep him from yelling more) I’m sorry, the dog almost got insi—

O: Whatever, OP, go print out your fucking checks. 


After all of that, I passed out all the checks, quietly apologizing for O’s behavior. I received hushed apologies back as they handed me their cards.


All my guests signed their checks and left. I bussed the tables and went to enter the tips and finally close out at 20 min till evening shift. My regulars tipped the normal 20% they always do, but the family and lady with the dog tipped closer to 30%.


But the best of all? The young couple, who had front row seats to this shit show? 30$ tip on a 24$ bill... and on the back of the receipt?


 “SORRY YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR BOSS :(“


I kept that slip of paper in my wallet for years.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This is only my second post here so please, bear with me and  excuse my grammar and format

Backstory: I work at a fairly popular seafood restaurant in a coastal town. My mother passed away when I was younger and it affected how I look at the world greatly. 
Now onto the story! 
I was working New Year’s Eve at the restaurant, and it was a pre fixed menu of four courses. I got to my table and didn’t even get to say my usual server spiel before this lovely lady said to me,  “ oh you just be Kylie, ya know I requested you because you have such a lovely face!” So this table had already started out nicely. Well she went on to tell me that she and her husband were going out tonight to cheer her up as her mother had recently passed. At this point I dropped my service face and got real with her. I told her that grief is like a handbag that’s the size of a suitcase at first, but after time and healing, it becomes like a small wallet. I told her I know what it feels like and I’m so sorry. At this point I brought out my animal pictures( I have 3 dogs And 4 cats) to try and cheer her up. She liked them so much she had me show her a new animal picture each time I brought a course or stopped to check on them. By the end of the meal, she liked me so much she got down the days I usually work so she could request me again. Overall a very wholesome and wonderful table 
Now fast forward to yesterday: I was in the service area putting in an order and one of the hostesses came to let me know this very insistent lady wanted to see me. I walk out and lo and behold, the woman from NYE was here. She told me that she wanted to stop by to give me a gift bag full of cat toys for my new kitten! It really warmed my heart to know I was able to make a difference in this woman’s life to the point where she bought cat toys thinking of me. She  wasn’t  even dining in the restaurants that day!

We have the dish washer who never changes the water so every morning we have to rewatch everything that’s “clean”. I’m talking black flakes of god knows what EVERYWHERE. It’s all in out glassware and all over our plates. He doesn’t rinse anything before putting it in the machine. Then when he’s putting it all away he doesn’t pick out anything that wasn’t clean s properly. All of our spoons get stuck together and we have to soak them. It’s a total hassle and NO ONE, not a single one of my four managers will fix it.

I went through a good month of the cooks calling me names in Spanish(which I am almost fluent in) and management wouldn’t do anything. The cooks were refusing to cook my orders because I have complained to management so I had to go to corporate. Now they cook my food but they are still difficult to work with. 

1st rule of working on a line-work the first ticket. But instead they do all of one type of dish at once and it just ends up sitting there. I’m talking “let me make 8 steaks when I only need one on the ticket and then put it in the window and have it die until everyone else has caught up to me”. 
2nd rule-don’t put up incomplete tickets. This becomes an issue 24/7. Then we all get yelled at for asking for the items they neglected to put on the plate.

And if I call for something let me know you heard me instead of having me call for it 6 times before you tell me to fuck off. It’s not rocket science. If I call for it and you say “heard” then I know it’s working.

,TalesFromYourServer,"For a long time, I worked for a restaurant that went by a person's name--let's call it Clarissa's Winery. Putting her name on the building attracted a lot of bad behavior. I couldn't go a week without someone claiming they were a friend of Clarissa's in hopes of a discount, and you'd be shocked how many of them had been “best friends since grade school”!

Fortunately, Clarissa was always in the restaurant, so it was never difficult to sort out which of them were full of shit. I'd light up with a huge smile and let each customer know the *great* news. ""I'm sure Clarissa would be *thrilled* to hear an old friend is here! I'd be happy to show you to her if you'd like to say hello."" Unsurprisingly, most of them were ""in too much of a hurry"", or they ""didn't want to disturb her"". Only one customer ever took me up on it. She hesitantly agreed before adding, ""I'm not sure she'll remember me. It's been a very long time.""

Enthusiastically, I lead her to the back of our dining room to a tall glass case featuring a statue of an angel. ""Here we are! This is Clarissa! She's celebrating her 30th anniversary with us so she's almost a local piece of history. Isn't she gorgeous?"" The customer and I stared at each other with poker faces for a long time before she said, ""yes, lovely... Where is your bathroom?"" and hurried away. No discount today, lady.

Only one customer ever took me up on it. She hesitantly agreed before adding, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not sure she&amp;#39;ll remember me. It&amp;#39;s been a very long time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastically, I lead her to the back of our dining room to a tall glass case featuring a statue of an angel. &amp;quot;Here we are! This is Clarissa! She&amp;#39;s celebrating her 30th anniversary with us so she&amp;#39;s almost a local piece of history. Isn&amp;#39;t she gorgeous?&amp;quot; The customer and I stared at each other with poker faces for a long time before she said, &amp;quot;yes, lovely... Where is your bathroom?&amp;quot; and hurried away. No discount today, lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, the owner Josephine was a family friend and let me get away with being a smart ass sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"This happened today. I work at a sports bar and grill, and we had full staff on today for the morning cause we get tons of to go orders for Super Bowl and needed as many hands as we could get to help. I’m in the bar area, and my 2nd or 3rd table of the day is a 10-top. No problem, I handle tables that big often and just yesterday I had a 20 and then a 40-top.

I want to preface this by saying I’m not busy at all the entire shift and had only 5 tables from 11-4pm, so I have time to spend on everyone. I’m very attentive as they’re waiting for everyone to arrive, grabbing drinks as soon as new people sit down, making small talk with everyone, and we all seem to be getting along fine. I get everyone’s food orders after I drop off the last 2 drinks.

When their food gets dropped off (by a food runner, not me), no one remembers what they ordered and they all moved seats so the runner can’t just go by seat numbers either. They get it sorted and I come back after they’ve had a *couple minutes* to eat and ask if everything is ok. They all say yes and go back to eating and talking. About *4 minutes* go by and they tell a host to find me because *they haven’t seen me in a while.* I go over and ask what’s up and they all need refills. Ok, no problem, I’ll be right back. It’s 10 whole refills, so I’m taking a bit longer than I would otherwise, but not by much. I’ve been back there *maybe a minute* when my manager comes back and starts saying the table number and I say “yeah, I’m grabbing their refills right now? Do they need anything else?” And she says “no, just refills. They’re getting kind of angry about them.”

So I take everything out, clear off old cups, drop at dish pit, and go back to grab any empty plates. As I’m walking up, the mom (who had a full cup of soda when I brought her refill) says to her daughter, “all of your food is cold by the time you get a refill.” Ok, I guess. I stop smiling at them and drop the customer service voice. They’re under no obligation to like me and neither am I.

I drop checks a bit later, pick them up and then drop change for those who need change. My restaurant doesn’t do coin change though, we round up or down a dollar depending on the amount. It’s never been an issue and is well known at all of the locations we have statewide that this is not a thing we do.

They request a manager, not through me, and complain that I didn’t give them their proper change. She’s irritated by them and just asks me to make nice so they’ll leave. I go over and apologize, say it’s not something we have ever done, but I can run back to my wallet and see what I have, it’ll just take me a minute. The mom says to me, “it’s not about the change, it’s about you not telling us you’re going to keep our money for yourself.”

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I work in a small ~~grocery store~~ cafe and this evening a woman walks in just before we were about to close. I was at the till so she comes up to me and starts telling me something about a fire next door and she was locked out of her house and we needed to help her. I didn't really understand what she was saying, but was definitely concerned and my immediate question was whether she had called the fire brigade. The conversation went something like this:

Lady: I can't call the fire brigade they won't come!!

Me: I can assure you they will, I live around here and have had to call before, if there's any chance of a fire they will definitely come

Lady: I've called them already, they said they won't come

At this point my colleague and manager were at the till and we were all super confused. After some more questioning we finally got the truth out. She had heard a fire alarm, thinking her neighbours house was on fire she went out into the hallway to have a look. After knocking on her neighbours door they told her it was just from cooking. When she turns around she realises she's locked herself out of her house with no phone or money. Shit situation, many of us have been there. I told her she just needed to call a locksmith, but she said it was too expensive. In the end she convinced my co-workers to go with her to try and help her break in, even though she had previously said her neighbour tried and she had told him to stop. The whole thing was so confusing and also annoying as I ended up being like 30 mins later out because of her slowing everyone down. I understand it's annoying to be locked out and I would have more than happily let her use the shop phone, or mine. But to expect some random people to come and fix your problem, when you could literally fix it yourself by calling a locksmith is beyond me.

Maybe I'm being harsh, but honestly she had so many other options (neighbour, locksmith), I hate how people expect customer service workers to fix literally every problem in their life. And the fact she wanted the fire brigade to come out to her house and break in, just because she didn't want to pay, is another level of selfish.

&lt;p&gt;Me: I can assure you they will, I live around here and have had to call before, if there&amp;#39;s any chance of a fire they will definitely come&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: I&amp;#39;ve called them already, they said they won&amp;#39;t come&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point my colleague and manager were at the till and we were all super confused. After some more questioning we finally got the truth out. She had heard a fire alarm, thinking her neighbours house was on fire she went out into the hallway to have a look. After knocking on her neighbours door they told her it was just from cooking. When she turns around she realises she&amp;#39;s locked herself out of her house with no phone or money. Shit situation, many of us have been there. I told her she just needed to call a locksmith, but she said it was too expensive. In the end she convinced my co-workers to go with her to try and help her break in, even though she had previously said her neighbour tried and she had told him to stop. The whole thing was so confusing and also annoying as I ended up being like 30 mins later out because of her slowing everyone down. I understand it&amp;#39;s annoying to be locked out and I would have more than happily let her use the shop phone, or mine. But to expect some random people to come and fix your problem, when you could literally fix it yourself by calling a locksmith is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m being harsh, but honestly she had so many other options (neighbour, locksmith), I hate how people expect customer service workers to fix literally every problem in their life. And the fact she wanted the fire brigade to come out to her house and break in, just because she didn&amp;#39;t want to pay, is another level of selfish. I wish people would take more responsibility and not expect everyone else to fix their problems for them!&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I work at a kind of eclectic burger bar. We’re owned by a company that operates other restaurants that are more traditional, but we have our own menu and focus a lot more on rotating beer taps and cocktails. My manager who hired me was literally the best manager I’ve ever worked under. Super busy lunch? He’s out on the floor seating people, bussing tables, making drinks, running food, could even hop on the grill if he needed to. If we were super busy he would even call us all over to the well to give us a shot or something to keep us laughing and mellowed out. He left because of a pay dispute (in my opinion they should’ve given him whatever he wanted) and we got the worst manager ever.

This guy is a total hippy burnout loser, but is also kind of a “bro” if that makes sense. First thing he does is hire on his and his wife’s girlfriend as a hostess and she is just the worst ever. Literally had to explain to her what a “rotation” was. But he is literally the laziest person I’ve ever worked for. He cut host and server hours, so now we’re expected to seat, bus, serve, and run food on a skeleton staff to a place that gets insane rush lunches because we’re located next to major office buildings in my city. If he’s in the restaurant, which is rare for him to actually show up, he literally will watch us drown while he drinks craft beer with reps at the bar, or go to the office to make the schedule and says he’s too busy to help. He spends time making the schedule? Oh no, I literally don’t get my schedule for the next week until Sunday and our old manager used to do it three weeks in advance. He always is trying to talk about his tattoos, which are pretty shitty, or just goes into the parking lot to smoke weed. Once even told me I smelled too much like cigarettes and he reeled of weed. He also changed the restaurants entire vibe by trying to make us wear a uniform, but let’s his favorites get away with wearing whatever they want. Also, he was pretty drunk at noon one day and bragged to me about how much money he makes which is just the trashiest thing I can imagine given our old manager left for a salary dispute.

He has denied my request off for a few days because I have a trip I’ve planned forever for a friend’s wedding and I told him I would be across the country. He tells me if I don’t show up, I’ll be fired even though I’m the guy who always trains new hires, bartends, serves, knows the menu more than anyone else, etc. I’m not showing up and I think I’ll tell the corporate owners just how terrible he is if I get fired. Thoughts?

Update: I did it. I used LinkedIn to find the boss above my manager’s boss’s email and told him the whole thing since we’ve always been friendly. Also told him that I would be leaving without notice as I just got offered a 9-5 position that wants me to start in two weeks and I want a week to center myself. This is a job where I can use my degree and I’m pretty excited about it. In a perfect world, I’d be able to stay on and pick up shifts on weekends to supplement my income, but we roll with the punches. I’m hoping that this guy gets removed quickly and my (former now) coworkers’ lives get easier.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I manage at a counter service place, a reasonably nice cafe within a park. Customers order and pay, and then we bring the food out to them. Weekends get very busy, but there are plenty of staff to manage those shifts. 

So today I’m walking the floor, and get called over by a lady who has just been served her food: a chicken and avocado salad. She indicates to her plate and tells me that there is a lot of rocket there. Now, the salad is listed as containing chicken, avocado, rocket, pomegranate and pancetta. It’s a nice salad, I have it a lot myself. So I politely point out to the lady that yes, the salad is indeed made with rocket. 

I thought she might say that she had read the menu incorrectly, but she then told me that she read that it came with rocket but assumed it would be a mixed salad. This was quite hard to respond to because... ? What more can a place do than list the ingredients in a dish? She certainly didn’t ask while ordering. So I tried to explain that as the meal was exactly as advertised and of good quality, and that it came out in a timely manner, that unfortunately I would neither refund her meal or swap it for something else, but I would take her comments as feedback for a potential menu change in future. 

She then told me I had poor customer service and that I could have at least offered her a new meal. At this point I really started to believe she  was entitled, as she was essentially suggesting I should replace her (perfectly good) meal as well as offer her more! So I stuck to my guns and again explained my position. At this point she cut me off and took out her phone, to start writing what turned out to be a bad review. 

I actually really pride myself on customer service, and get a fair amount of praise from my regulars. I will go the extra mile to help someone find a dish they can eat, or fix something that’s not quite right, but everyone has to draw a line somewhere. I won’t start giving free food out to anyone that won’t read - I do have a business to run. 

Just ugh, been stewing all evening and trying to shake it off, I think the fact that she called me condescending in her review has really got to me, because I did my absolute best to be polite and honest with her.

Edit: thanks for the support and some opposing opinions. I still stick by how I handled it as I believed it is fair for the venue and the country in which I work.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I have worked roughly 11 years in the restaurant industry in both Arizona and California, ranging from Fast Food to Dine In. It's been over a decade since I've worked in any type of restaurant, however some outstanding events will never leave my memory.

I'll post this one first and when I have the time, I'll post others. 

I used to be a server at a popular seafood restaurant in the Inland Empire. There was a large Black population in the city the restaurant was in, so a large portion of our guests would be Black people. This never bothered me because, well, why the heck should it? I took care of everyone all the same who crossed my path and I've never had any issues. 

Well, it wasn't until I was about a month into this restaurant and working the lunch shift that I started to fully pay attention to how my fellow servers treated customers. This particular day had a lot of Black guests. There were groans coming from my co-workers, all complaining that Black people are cheap, they don't tip, blah blah blah. So I asked one server if it's that much of an issue for you, I'll be happy to take your table. They happily said yes. Soon the majority of servers all gave up their tables to me simply because the people were Black and they thought it would be a waste of time. 

I was really pissed and disappointed in everyone, but I didn't have too much of a backbone nor an understanding of how to begin to have a talk about race with others, so I did the next best thing. Any time a table had left, I went to check my tip then I went to the server who gave up their table to me and told them how much I was tipped. Each time it was at least 20% tip, each time they seemed shocked and a little upset they gave up the table. By the end of my shift, I made about $200, though that would be the only time I would ever make that during lunch because other servers didn't give up as many tables to me anymore. 

After the lunch rush I had come to the conclusion that maybe Black people don't suck at tipping, maybe your crappy attitude towards them affects how you serve them and you just suck. Why should they tip you?

It&amp;#39;s been over a decade since I&amp;#39;ve worked in any type of restaurant, however some outstanding events will never leave my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll post this one first and when I have the time, I&amp;#39;ll post others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a server at a popular seafood restaurant in the Inland Empire. There was a large Black population in the city the restaurant was in, so a large portion of our guests would be Black people. This never bothered me because, well, why the heck should it? I took care of everyone all the same who crossed my path and I&amp;#39;ve never had any issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn&amp;#39;t until I was about a month into this restaurant and working the lunch shift that I started to fully pay attention to how my fellow servers treated customers. This particular day had a lot of Black guests. There were groans coming from my co-workers, all complaining that Black people are cheap, they don&amp;#39;t tip, blah blah blah. So I asked one server if it&amp;#39;s that much of an issue for you, I&amp;#39;ll be happy to take your table. They happily said yes. Soon the majority of servers all gave up their tables to me simply because the people were Black and they thought it would be a waste of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really pissed and disappointed in everyone, but I didn&amp;#39;t have too much of a backbone nor an understanding of how to begin to have a talk about race with others, so I did the next best thing. Any time a table had left, I went to check my tip then I went to the server who gave up their table to me and told them how much I was tipped. Each time it was at least 20% tip, each time they seemed shocked and a little upset they gave up the table. By the end of my shift, I made about $200, though that would be the only time I would ever make that during lunch because other servers didn&amp;#39;t give up as many tables to me anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lunch rush I had come to the conclusion that maybe Black people don&amp;#39;t suck at tipping, maybe your crappy attitude towards them affects how you serve them and you just suck. Why should they tip you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arizona, Mexican people were the targets of this stereotyping. Again, I&amp;#39;ve never had an issue with any person of any race. I was tipped based on how well I served them or from what they could afford. Everyone deserves to have a night out, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they can also afford to tip generously.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Our kitchen has been going through a turnover recently so nearly every night is a complete shit show. Since last night was Saturday it was a shit show on crack. The line at the door was pretty long because it was taking double the amount of time it usually does to turn tables because food was running quite late. 

My restaurant is family friendly so we have highchairs and booster seats but obviously not enough for every table to have one. A host asked me if he could take the highchair from my table because they were all being used and someone at the door needed a highchair. 

My table had their baby sitting on the moms lap when he asked but they were using the chair before and they weren’t even halfway done their meal so there was probably a solid chance they would be putting the baby back in the chair at some point. 

I didn’t think it was right to ask them because if they’re not assertive people they might feel pressured to say yes which I think isn’t fair to them. I also had already had to move them to a different table because we needed to conjoin tables for a party so I felt like if I asked them to give me their highchair too they would think our restaurant is an unorganized shit show which it is but you gotta fake it til you make it. 

I told the host no then asked my coworker who is very experienced and a mother if she agrees with me and she said I absolutely did the right thing. A lot of the hosts are new so their shit was whack too so I was helping them at the door. 

The next people in line to be sat were the ones who needed a highchair so I asked them if the host had already told them they were next but we don’t have a highchair so we can seat them without it or wait for a highchair. They said he told them but asked me if we could take the highchair from my table which was visible from where they were standing. So I realized at that point the host didn’t actually want to take my highchair he was just asking because they asked him if he could take that specific highchair. I told them my logic as to why I couldn’t take their highchair so they rephrased and said “we’re not saying you have to take their highchair but you can at least ask because they might not even want it anymore”. So I told them I would not be doing that because I’m not about to police my tables seating arrangement in the middle of their meal. I said it nicer than that though lmao. 

They responded with “ok but you can at least ask”. I told them I’d go ask my manager because I realized at that point there was no point in trying to reason with a human wall. I didn’t actually ask her because she was so busy and I’ve been working there long enough that I know she would much rather me make a judgment call myself than interrupt what she’s doing to explain the situation. 

A few minutes later a highchair became available so the host sat the family and unfortunately is was my section.

So it's dinner rush on a Saturday night. 4 top.

I apologized but really wanted to tell her they should've come at a less busy time if they want super quick service.

Nothing else really happens until after dessert. I see they are done and plates are empty. I go to clear them and even say ""are we all finished here? I can take these and make room."" She got so mad. She yelled that I don't need to bother coming back to the table because they were going to be sitting there and don't expect her to pay the bill any time soon. She also was angry I was taking the plates and when she saw I had everyone else's, she told me to put them down. Her family said they were done and she literally threw her fork.

Time goes on and I avoid the table. I notice she's in the bathroom so I go ask if anyone wants refills. The husband apologized and told me to let him pay because she wasn't being very nice and knew she'd stiff me. I took his payment and as soon as he filled it out, she came back.

One was a few weeks ago. I had a table of two ladies and a teenage boy that came in the dead time of the afternoon and ate. They were all very nice and seemed very happy with everything. One of the women asked if we were currently hiring and I told them that currently no, but I could still give her an application in case something changes. Both women mentioned multiple times that they used to wait tables. They didnt leave me a single penny. 

Then just the other day a woman and her boyfriend came in and were sat in a different servers section. I've known them both for a few years and I actually used to work with the woman. She is a waitress at another restaurant in town and honestly, she is a really bad server. 

So they waved me over to say hi and chit chat, she asked if we were hiring. I told her the same thing as the other women, no but I can get you an application in case something changes. 

Their server is pretty good at her job and it was slow at the time so I could tell they got excellent service. No tip. 

That one really made me mad. Especially since she has it stuck in her head that I would give her a recommendation if we were hiring. I had her as a friend on facebook and I just deleted her right away after that. She of all people should know how much servers rely on tips.

,TalesFromYourServer,"  Hello pals. I'm more of a lurker and occasional commenter, and this is my first time posting here so forgive me if my formatting is off at all.

  This happened over last summer, when I worked for a small but established fine dining Italian restaurant. Open dinnertime, and they hold events during the day, and also offer catering. Clientele was, as you can imagine, old, rich, and white. Most of our regulars, and we mostly served regulars, were some of the best and kindest people I've ever met, and were a real pleasure to work for. Except this guy and his wife, which I would learn about later on. I was fairly new to the restaurant biz, had only been working for a couple months at this point. I was recruited along with one other server to do my very first catering job. They had their own food, they just wanted a couple servers to help out, and impress they're guests I assume. We don't typically do that, but because he was a loyal regular it was agreed to as a favor (not a free favor, we still got paid). 

  The home was lovely, and a very clear sign they had MONEY, so initially I was ready to kiss some ass for tips. We came in all black, considering that is uniform and we weren't told to do otherwise. That's when the wife, in all of her stiff, plastic glory, (she was a fan of cosmetic procedures) told us the party would be held outside, in 100 degree weather, and that she would lend us a couple of her own white shirts. She lead my coworker, ""Beth"" and I up to her massive closet, and while she was rifling through her shirts, we noticed the excessive T2020 and MAGA hats everywhere. I was glad the wife's back was turned, because Beth could not hide the shock and disdain on her face upon seeing them. Beth and her husband are hardcore, passionate liberals, and have a lot of hatred for our current president. I suppressed a giggle as wife handed us the shirts and lead us into another room to change. After we changed, we went downstairs to be ordered around. 

  This is where the fun begins. 

  Right off the bat, they treated me, a brown girl of 23, differently than Beth, a white woman of her 50's. I was addressed as ""you"" or ""young lady"" half the time, and they had me running around doing all the grunt work while Beth was basically being treated almost like a guest. I didn't really think too much of it at the time, I was just trying to make some money. However, I did start to get annoyed when the husband would over explain little things to me in a way that you would teach a young clueless child, such as opening a bottle of wine. I worked in fine dining, we served a lot of wine. What makes you think I don't know how to do something this simple?? Instead, I just observe and nod my head obediently, not wanting to give my boss a bad reputation.

  The wife was a nightmare. For whatever reason, she had decided to put the food out about an hour before guests arrived. Gross, but okay whatever. She literally had me standing there with an electric fly swatter for a majority of the time, trying to swat away flies. At one point, she yells at me from across the yard, in front of the entire party, ""ARE YOU EVEN TRYING TO KILL THESE DAMN FLIES??"" To be honest, I didn't say anything, although I wish I had, just kind of side eyed her. We're fucking outside, there's bound to be bugs flying around your under cooked salmon. Not to mention there's nowhere for me to like corner them and kill them. I guess I should known better than to leave my go go gadget arm at home, my fucking fault. 

  Anyway, fast forward to 7pm, when we finally get to leave. The party had migrated inside for dessert. I had come downstairs after changing and grabbing my things, saw Beth speaking to the husband and collecting our envelopes with our sweet sweet moolah inside, and start to head over. I was stopped by a skinny middle aged man with an earring dangling from his ear, who reminded me of a bootleg Joe Rodhe. The following dialogue ensues:

Joe: I heard your name was Maria!

He had made a clear effort to roll his r in order to impress the brown girl, who by the way, isn't even fluent in spanish. I looked at him, shocked, and said excuse me? and he repeats himself.

Me: No, my name is \*insert name\* (i have an r in my name, and made it a point to enunciate it very hard to emphasize the fact that i do indeed speaky the engrish) can I help you?

Joe: Oh, well \*insert my name\*, where are you from?

Me: I'm from \*town name\*

Joe: Oh, I've never heard of \*town name\*, what country is that?

Me, going from shock to obvious annoyance: It's like two towns over, I'm American SIR.

Joe: No, no, that's not what I'm asking you! You're heritage, like where are your PARENTS from?

Me: Well, my mom is Puerto Rican, and my dad is Cambodian. Why?

Joe: Oh well you look sO eXoTiC, I just had to know! You know, I'M from so and so myself and blah blah blah

  He proceeded to tell me all about whatever European country his family was from, and I was just looking at him, not listening, just waiting for him to be done. His friend chimes in, a bootleg Jack Black with glasses, who had been standing there listening the entire time, then proceeded to tell me about all the work he did in the capital city back in the 90's called Project La Viva (cringe) which apparently somehow helped inner city Puerto Rican's out SIGNIFICANTLY. Good for you, I'm sure you feel real good about yourself for helping out the poor brown people 20 years ago. What that does for me, and why he expected me to be impressed, I have no clue. I'm pretty sure I just responded with a flat ""cool"". I grew up an hour away from the city in a nice suburban town. Finally, Husband pulls me away and hands me an envelope meant for me, with my name incorrect, (at least he didn't put Maria) and sends us on his way. We each received $300 for 4 hours, which I was happy about. 

  In the car on our way back to our restaurant, Beth had pointed out how they had treated us differently, and how it really frustrated her, which was when I had told her about my encounter with the bootleg twins. I was still processing everything as I told her, and hadn't realized just how inherently ignorant these men had been towards me. She was enraged, more so than I was at that moment, and was going off the entire ride about how if she had overhead she would have said something, and how she knew once she saw the MAGA hats everywhere that there would be problems. Back at the restaurant, she had me tell everyone the story, including the owner, who never did the couple any favors ever again. That's when everyone told me how much they can't stand them, how entitled they are. One of the servers even told me that one night while serving them, the table next to her tipped half their bill, and left a note on the receipt saying how sorry they were that she had to deal with the asshole couple. I felt a lot better after hearing everyone's, and even the owners complaints against them, and appreciated how supportive everyone was upon hearing my story.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, fast forward to 7pm, when we finally get to leave. The party had migrated inside for dessert. I had come downstairs after changing and grabbing my things, saw Beth speaking to the husband and collecting our envelopes with our sweet sweet moolah inside, and start to head over. I was stopped by a skinny middle aged man with an earring dangling from his ear, who reminded me of a bootleg Joe Rodhe. The following dialogue ensues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe: I heard your name was Maria!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had made a clear effort to roll his r in order to impress the brown girl, who by the way, isn&amp;#39;t even fluent in spanish. I looked at him, shocked, and said excuse me? and he repeats himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: No, my name is *insert name* (i have an r in my name, and made it a point to enunciate it very hard to emphasize the fact that i do indeed speaky the engrish) can I help you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe: Oh, well *insert my name*, where are you from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m from *town name*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe: Oh, I&amp;#39;ve never heard of *town name*, what country is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, going from shock to obvious annoyance: It&amp;#39;s like two towns over, I&amp;#39;m American SIR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe: No, no, that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m asking you! You&amp;#39;re heritage, like where are your PARENTS from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Well, my mom is Puerto Rican, and my dad is Cambodian. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe: Oh well you look sO eXoTiC, I just had to know! You know, I&amp;#39;M from so and so myself and blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He proceeded to tell me all about whatever European country his family was from, and I was just looking at him, not listening, just waiting for him to be done. His friend chimes in, a bootleg Jack Black with glasses, who had been standing there listening the entire time, then proceeded to tell me about all the work he did in the capital city back in the 90&amp;#39;s called Project La Viva (cringe) which apparently somehow helped inner city Puerto Rican&amp;#39;s out SIGNIFICANTLY. Good for you, I&amp;#39;m sure you feel real good about yourself for helping out the poor brown people 20 years ago. What that does for me, and why he expected me to be impressed, I have no clue. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I just responded with a flat &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot;. I grew up an hour away from the city in a nice suburban town. Finally, Husband pulls me away and hands me an envelope meant for me, with my name incorrect, (at least he didn&amp;#39;t put Maria) and sends us on his way. We each received $300 for 4 hours, which I was happy about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the car on our way back to our restaurant, Beth had pointed out how they had treated us differently, and how it really frustrated her, which was when I had told her about my encounter with the bootleg twins. I was still processing everything as I told her, and hadn&amp;#39;t realized just how inherently ignorant these men had been towards me. She was enraged, more so than I was at that moment, and was going off the entire ride about how if she had overhead she would have said something, and how she knew once she saw the MAGA hats everywhere that there would be problems. Back at the restaurant, she had me tell everyone the story, including the owner, who never did the couple any favors ever again. That&amp;#39;s when everyone told me how much they can&amp;#39;t stand them, how entitled they are. One of the servers even told me that one night while serving them, the table next to her tipped half their bill, and left a note on the receipt saying how sorry they were that she had to deal with the asshole couple. I felt a lot better after hearing everyone&amp;#39;s, and even the owners complaints against them, and appreciated how supportive everyone was upon hearing my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story, please don&amp;#39;t assume that the young brown server with slanty eye&amp;#39;s name is Maria&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I'm writing this from work right now. This just happened and it's got my blood boiling so I've gotta share it with someone.

I work in a hotel restaurant. The restaurant has a takeout/coffee station and I am working that station tonight. These 4 men come in, get some coffees and sit down at the couches to hang out and chat. So far, all is well. 

About 15 minutes later, they come up and grab an apple and an orange. They hold them up and ask, ""are these free?"" Obviously, I say no. They still want them so I start punching them in. They see the total appear and complain, ""oh my god, $1.50 EACH?!"" I say nothing but I'm getting irritated. They pay and then ask me for a plate and a knife to cut up the fruits. I oblige. Instead of going back to the couches (where there is a perfectly good table), the man starts messily cutting up his  orange right on my counter. Then he returns to his seat. 

Another 15 or so minutes pass before one of them comes up to the counter again. I already know some dumb shit is gonna happen again so I try to mentally prepare myself. The man asks where he can wash his hands. I direct him to the bathroom which is no more than 15 feet away. Apparently, that's too much of an inconvenience for his fucking majesty because he says, ""I'll just do it here"" and proceeds to start walking behind the counter. I repeatedly say ""no, no, no, sir, NO, you can't be back here."" He ignores me. I state again, more firmly this time, ""SIR, you CANNOT be behind the counter. There is a washroom RIGHT OVER THERE. Go wash your hands there.""

Guys, this man looks me dead in the fuckin eyes, says ""oh, okay"" and then TURNS ON THE FAUCET OF MY SINK and rinses his hands. Then he goes to the bathroom. 

I am a patient woman but I almost lost it. Who does that? I feel like it's pretty common knowledge that guests are not allowed behind the counter. That's why we have the little swinging half-door thing.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Two hours before close last night, we had a group of 9 walk in for a table. Slightly annoying, but the host found a couple tables to clean off for them and seated them. While their server was getting their drinks, a large group of people came in and said they were joining the 9 top. Their group then became 25, and we had to clean off more tables to put together for them. Their server started getting more drink orders, while some of the people who got there first loudly complained about how long the service was taking. 

The server frantically put in their food orders (lots of steaks and large dishes that take a while to cook) while the rest of us helped take care of his other tables and our own. While he was putting in food, another group of people walked in to join the big group, putting them at a grand total of 36. We had to clean off more tables, which was hindered by a couple of the joiners grabbing the tables and pulling them away from us while we were trying to clean them. People started complaining they didn't have drinks yet, while our one bartender was doing her best pumping out big flavored margaritas and preparing their multiple drink towers. Another server jumped behind the bar to help while the rest of us ran the drinks as they came out. 

Since we were nearing the end of the night when they ordered their food, the kitchen and our two chefs were in no way prepared. Most of the prepped food and veggies had been gone through, and the dishwasher had to step into overdrive to clean enough plates for all that food.  The chefs got the food out as quick as they could, and all the servers ran dishes as soon as they hit the counter. Getting the right meals out was a challenge, because all the people apparently immediately forgot what they ordered and would just stare at me when I loudly called out whatever meals I had. 

Within all the chaos, the chefs had forgotten to make a few meals. By this point, most of the people who were eating were already done and ready to leave. A few people started swarming the server at the computer, demanding comped drinks and free food (on top of their 20% military discounts) for having to wait so long (because it's definitely our fault you walked in with a group of over 30 people and apparently don't have a concept of how long food takes to cook). People sitting at the table were loudly complaining about all of us and the restaurant itself, and were threatening to leave bad reviews. 

Then, the kicker. They all wanted separate bills. Our computer cannot even separate that many bills at once, so all of us were telling their server to just give them one bill and let them know that restaurant policy doesn't let us split that many bills. However, since they were complaining so much (and a few people kept mentioning that they're all active military members), the server did his best to split the bills and put the drinks and food where he could. He tried asking his table for help, but clearly some people lied to him and he ended up with over $60 worth of unclaimed food and drinks after everyone had paid. The food was comped, but he had to pay out over $20 for the drinks that people had and nobody paid for. Some people tipped him nicely and others not at all, and they left large messes of chips and salsas and cheese all over the tables. 

Incredibly, while that 30 top threw the restaurant and servers into chaos, the rest of the tables we had were all amazingly patient and understanding. My last table had to wait almost an hour for their food to come out, and I didn't hear a single complaint from them. I am very, very thankful that at least the other tables recognized that the problem was the large table and didn't also try getting free stuff because they had to wait. 

Now the goal is to convince the boss to not allow big groups to walk in without a warning like that and to forbid a group of over 30 people to pay separately. 

TLDR; A group of 9 walked in for a table and multiplied to become 36 people. They complained about how long it took one person to make 25+ drinks, how long it took two people to cook 20+ meals, how long it took three people to run out plates and plates of food at a time, then demanded free meals and drinks to make up for the problems that they themselves caused.",t2_1ouufv,False,,0,False,The 9 top walk in that became a (very rude and entitled) 36,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ewq6ce,False,dark,,public,207,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,207,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1580513945.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hours before close last night, we had a group of 9 walk in for a table.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Early in the autumn a few years ago, I had a table that was sat outside on our patio facing the main strip of our city.

After they were sat, the city had begun to do work on the sewage system just down the road. DELICIOUS! Our patio was in the damage radius too... it smelled like sewage out there.

I realized that this was happening when I went to deliver their drinks and was nearly KO'ed by the smell. You'd think that they would see/smell what was happening and come inside and tell the host or me that they wanted a table inside **right away**...it was bad.

Nope.

Instead, they decided to complain about it to me when I came outside. ""Can you ask them to stop? We're trying to eat out here.""

""Hahaha, No I cannot. (I actually laughed). We have tables inside, though. It's totally fine in there."" 

The two of them look at each other like I'm some kind of idiot. Then the lady looks back at me and with a bunch of attitude goes, ""We wanted to dine outside today because it's nice, and we can't do it with this smell. We *really* want to sit outside and enjoy our dining experience. What can *you* do to fix this situation?"" 

""Nothing."" She stares at me for a second into my unwavering ""seriously lady, wtf"" face.

They eventually went inside, of course. And proceeded to be annoyed the whole time. Forgot if they ever wrote a review or anything but they were miserable and punished my wallet for their 'inconvenience'. 

I'm also fairly sure that it would be some kind of health code violation to walk up to *an active sewage system maintenance task* while I'm *AT WORK AS A SERVER, SERVING FOOD.*

Bonus: all sorts of people that would ask us ""cAn yOU aSk tHaT gUy a hAlF BloCk aWaY to sToP sMoKinG thAt CIGaR?"" - nope.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Very busy day. I was the only server on, and there was only one person working the BoH, lunches are usually slow hence why I was working the FoH entirely by myself, but today was a fluke and I got my ass handed to me out of nowhere. 

I try to give every guest that I serve the same level of respect and kindness, no matter what attitude they have towards me and no matter how many silly requests they ask of me, but today I was just TOO. DAMN. BUSY. to put up with it. 

So today, I had 14 tables walk in almost simultaneously. Seriously there was maybe a 15 minute window between the restaurant being completely empty and then filling up with 14 tables, two of which were 8 tops. One of the 8 tops was a group of older people. They were needy, and they all seemed to have questions for me that could have been answered if they had *actually read the damn menu* but whatever, I’m used to that happening with people. They give me their tables order and I put it in, and as I’m still seating the door and walking past their table to seat other guests, one lady at their table keeps stopping me by grabbing my arm just to ask “how long?” Or “where is *random shop down the road* ?” And even “whats your favorite thing to do around town?” 

Now the first couple times she stopped me (keep in mind that I’m in the middle of SEATING OTHER PEOPLE who are now stopped with me because this lady tugged on my arm and made me stop) I answered each question, a bit hastily, but I still answered her and went about my business. The fourth time she did this I just snapped. She tugged my arm, as usual, and began to ask me something, and in the heat of the moment I cut her off and said “I’m assisting other guests at this time and you are preventing me from doing so efficiently. Please be patient and I will come answer any questions you have in a few minutes as I am currently very busy helping other people. Thanks.” And just walked away. 

You guys.

I was the only server on, and there was only one person working the BoH, lunches are usually slow hence why I was working the FoH entirely by myself, but today was a fluke and I got my ass handed to me out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to give every guest that I serve the same level of respect and kindness, no matter what attitude they have towards me and no matter how many silly requests they ask of me, but today I was just TOO. DAMN. BUSY. to put up with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I had 14 tables walk in almost simultaneously. Seriously there was maybe a 15 minute window between the restaurant being completely empty and then filling up with 14 tables, two of which were 8 tops. One of the 8 tops was a group of older people. They were needy, and they all seemed to have questions for me that could have been answered if they had &lt;em&gt;actually read the damn menu&lt;/em&gt; but whatever, I’m used to that happening with people. They give me their tables order and I put it in, and as I’m still seating the door and walking past their table to seat other guests, one lady at their table keeps stopping me by grabbing my arm just to ask “how long?” Or “where is &lt;em&gt;random shop down the road&lt;/em&gt; ?” And even “whats your favorite thing to do around town?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the first couple times she stopped me (keep in mind that I’m in the middle of SEATING OTHER PEOPLE who are now stopped with me because this lady tugged on my arm and made me stop) I answered each question, a bit hastily, but I still answered her and went about my business. The fourth time she did this I just snapped. She tugged my arm, as usual, and began to ask me something, and in the heat of the moment I cut her off and said “I’m assisting other guests at this time and you are preventing me from doing so efficiently. Please be patient and I will come answer any questions you have in a few minutes as I am currently very busy helping other people. Thanks.” And just walked away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guys. &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"In July 2019, I started serving at the restaurant I've been greeter at for the past four years. I've seen drama go down in the back, but never have I really been involved in it until this past Thursday. I've debated sharing the experience, but now that I look back on it, it's fucking great.

I was a greeter that night (I do this occasionally if they really need someone). A party of ten comes in for a birthday party, and they have a cake the size of a small rectangle table. I asked them where they got it, and they told me. After that, we got the manager to put it in our cooler until they were ready to cut it. Pretty normal so far.

The closing manager made a joke about how everyone needs to watch me because I might steal a piece. This manager makes jokes all the time, he's a great guy, so this wasn't the problem. It was one of the SERVERS taking care of the party.

After they had eaten almost all of the cake, I went to clean a table next to them and they asked if I wanted the last piece. I made sure they were okay with giving it to me, and they said yes, so I got to take a pretty big-sized piece of cake home with me.

I'm packing it up, and one of the servers came up to me, scoffed, and said, ""Ugh, the GREETER getting a piece of their cake, but not the SERVERS that took care of them? That's ridiculous!"" I even offer to cut it in half for her to be nice, but she just walked away. So then I went home. A little tense, but that's all.

Fast forward to Saturday, and I'm at my serving shift. My GM approaches me and asks if I wouldn't leave a party alone for their cake. Of course I say no, because, well, yeah, that's not what happened. ""That's what I thought,"" she tells me before walking away.

At this point I'm almost in tears because I'm so angry. Why would the party call and report me about something that isn't true?

Later that day I find out that the server who was all pissy about me getting cake was the one to report me. The guests didn't even call or say anything to anybody! The Thursday closing manager was there on Saturday, so he told me what happened when I left. The server kept on raving about how I was harassing those guests and that I'm selfish and shit like that. She then reported me to our GM. Just her. The other server didn't say anything.

In the words of that manager, ""she was just jealous because you were offered a piece and she wasn't.""

We worked together a few days ago, after this incident blew over. She was nicer to me than normal. Probably because she knew she was in the wrong. I still work there, for now. But at least I can trust my management team to believe me when someone accuses me of something outside of my character.

&lt;p&gt;It was so sweet and so wholesome. I loved hearing that&lt;/p&gt;

Putting the lemonade in first prevents it from frothing up and not separating like this woman’s drink had.

“It’s that you, then? Are you done?”

“Yes, I promise there is nothing wrong with it. Take it back to your table, try it and if you still don’t like it, I’ll make you another.”

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hey guys! On mobile blah blah. So I have two lovely stories about two different bitches named Kim.

First of all the card swiper on our register sucks. You have to swipe it at the perfect angle usually multiple times to get it to work correctly and sometimes we have to type the card in if it's particularly annoying. Most customers understand this and I get the occasional ""woah how many times ya gonna charge me haha"" stupid joke. 

But this lady started yelling at my 16 year old cashier to stop swiping her card so my cashier began typing it in when I walk over to see why she's yelling.

Me: Hi ma'am what seems to be the problem?

Kim: This girl charged me three times for my food and is now asking for the security code on my card! 

Me: Sorry ma'am we actually haven't charged you at all yet because our card reader sucks and sometimes we have to swipe it more than once to get it to go through 

Kim: I've been coming here for 6 years and that's never happened before! This is ridiculous. 

Me: I assure you ma'am we just need to type in the security code, you'll only be charged once and then you'll be good to go.

She grumbles and hands my cashier back the card who is visible upset and finishes the transaction. 

I thought that would be the end of it but she ends up leaving a bad review saying we charged her 4 times for her food, so my shift lead calls her to ask about it. Shift lead gave her free food even though she couldn't prove it but oh well.

She comes in the next day, complains to each person making her food, but doesn't say anything to the cashier and glares at her the whole time. Leaves another review saying she plans on only going to our other location from now on. Good riddance lmao. 

And today! I had just finished this UberEats order and sent it out when I get a call from another lady named Kim.

Kim: I'd like to speak to a manager. 

Me: Hi! Our manager is actually on her 30 minute break right now is there something I can help you with.

Kim: You charged me 8 dollars for a veggie taco. I want a refund. 

Me: No problem you just have to file it through the UberEats app as we don't have control over refunds that came through them

Kim: Get your manager now. Tell her to clock back in. 

Me: I'm afraid it's actually illegal to clock back in from a 30 minute break early

Kim: Oh do you think you're a lawyer

I laugh on accident. Me: No ma'am you can Google it (probably shouldn't have said this but oh well)

Kim: Get me your manager you fat fucking idiot

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but I already told you how to solve this problem and you're being extremely rude to me so I'm going to hang up now.

And I did! Told my shift lead about it and she says I don't have to deal with people talking to me like that and that I did the right thing.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I've been hanging out here for a while, but this is my first post. For context, I'm a waitress in the dining room of an independent living retirement facility. I've worked there for three and a half years now, which means that I'm the server with the most experience. This will be relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

**Players:**

Me: little old me

M: Former Manager (he was my manager at the time that this took place)

OS: Other Server

G: the aforementioned gluten free gremlin

GM: the Gremlin's mother

C: Chef.

&amp;#x200B;

So, at this retirement community, we do tours for people who are inquiring about moving into the facility. The people touring are often accompanied by their children. As a part of this tour, they are invited to have lunch in our dining room. Because I have the most experience at this place, I end up taking most of the tours, in order to make sure they get the best service, because we want these people to move into the facility.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the marketing director brings in the tour in the middle of lunch service. It was a pretty slow day, so I was in a really good mood, and I was almost finished with the two other tables that had been in my section. I also generally enjoyed serving the tours, because usually they were lovely (more polite than most of the actual residents, that was for sure). 

&amp;#x200B;

Not these people.

&amp;#x200B;

We get them sat down, with menus, and I bring them water. I do the standard ""hi my name's **Me** and I'll be your server today, can I get you two anything else to drink today, etc.""

&amp;#x200B;

And right off the bat, I can tell that **G** is going to be a problem. She looked me dead in the eyes and said ""where is your gluten-free menu?""

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** ""I'm sorry, I don't believe we have one. I can certainly go speak to our chef, though, to determine which items are gluten-free""

(Note: I've worked in restaurants for a while, and had had a long-term boyfriend with Celiac's, so I was pretty familiar with what gluten free meant.)

&amp;#x200B;

**G,** in the snarkiest way you can imagine: ""Well, that sounds like more of a hassle than it's worth. Why don't you have a gluten-free menu?""

&amp;#x200B;

**Me,** heartrate rising, because I could *smell* the karen on this woman**:** ""To my knowledge, we haven't had more than one or two gluten-free residents in the past few years. I don't think that my managers have ever felt that a gluten-free menu was necessary, given that fact.""

&amp;#x200B;

**G,** now speaking as though I'm about 5 years old**:** ""well, now, I don't think that's quite true, especially in today's day and age. Everyone's got something.""

&amp;#x200B;

(Side note: calling me a liar is the easiest way to get on my bad side. I know this dining room like the back of my hand, I know each and every resident that eats in my dining room, and I know if they have any restrictions, because dining restrictions show up in our POS. I'm also not stupid.)

&amp;#x200B;

(Other side note: perhaps, in 'today's day and age', everyone does have something. However, recall that the age group that I serve in my dining room is, like, anywhere from 65 to 100+ years old. In that generation, very few people have *got something*.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Me**, trying to keep calm, because these are guests: ""like I said earlier, I can certainly go check with the chef for you, to figure out what your mom can eat.""

&amp;#x200B;

(and at that point, that's all I could do. I don't know the ins and outs of every recipe on the menu. I don't work in the kitchen, so, while I could have taken a pretty good guess, it wouldn't be perfect)

&amp;#x200B;

**G**, with the most patronizing smile, acid in her voice: ""okay, clearly you're not understanding what gluten-free means. It depends on the way that the food is cooked, and so we can't just go through the menu item by item in order to determine what is or isn't gluten-free. So, why don't you do your job, and tell me what on this menu my mother can eat.""

&amp;#x200B;

I have never bitten my tongue that hard in my life. I swear I saw red. I could feel myself growing closer and closer to tears, and I knew that I needed to get away from them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me,** forcing a smile: ""well, I'll go talk to the chef and see what we can do for you, okay?""

&amp;#x200B;

I walked away from that table, as quickly as I could. As soon as I got back to the kitchen, I went and found **M**. I told him that I needed someone else to take that table, and that I was no longer going to be serving them, because I would not deal with someone who talked to me like that.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the other servers (**OS**) heard me half-crying, half-speaking, and offered to take the table. She spoke to the chef, then went out in the dining room, and allegedly, the following interaction took place (I was in the break room, trying to calm down).

&amp;#x200B;

**OS:** ""hi, my name is **OS,** and there are a couple of things we can arrange that are gluten-free--""

&amp;#x200B;

**G**: ""oh, finally, someone who knows what they're talking about. Hopefully you're more competent than that other girl""

&amp;#x200B;

**OS:** ""I apologize if you felt that way about your other server; however, we don't have a lot of experience serving gluten-free guests, as we haven't had that many in the past.""

&amp;#x200B;

**G,** progressively more furious and condescending**:** ""You know what, I take back what I said. Clearly you and your coworkers have no idea what gluten-free means, or how many people it affects. There are so many people who can't have gluten, I can't imagine that you've never had one here. And, like I explained to that *other girl*, we can't just look at the menu and decide what's gluten-free, it has to be prepared in a special way.""

&amp;#x200B;

**OS** didn't say anything else before she walked away. **M** was the next victim of the table, and **G** pulled him aside to chew him out about how awful his servers are.

&amp;#x200B;

(Side note: when I say pulled him aside, I mean she pulled him away from the table. Into the middle of the dining room. Within earshot of every server. And the remaining residents in the dining room.)

&amp;#x200B;

**G** spent about 10 minutes informing **M** about how awful service had been, how terribly she and her mother had been treated, and how incompetent **Me** and **OS** were. She didn't understand this generation (referring to **OS** and **I--**and, by extension, almost every other server in the place) could be so lazy and useless.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, something to know is that **M** was fiercely protective of his team. We were, for all intents and purposes, a very tight knit family, and he was everyone's Work-Dad. Furthermore, he had the worst temper of anyone that I've ever met. Maybe I'll make another post about him sometime.

&amp;#x200B;

**M** stormed back into the kitchen, with literal steam coming out of his ears. Also crying. At this point, **C** volunteered to take the table. Funnily enough, **G** was perfectly pleasant to **C** (because she knew he'd be the one making her food).

&amp;#x200B;

When **C** came back to the kitchen, he informed us that **GM** had several other dietary restrictions that we hadn't been informed about. She couldn't eat pork or fish or beef. She couldn't eat green vegetables. No gluten. No seasoning. This resulted in the blandest looking dish I had ever seen--if I recall correctly, it was a plainer than plain chicken breast, with a side of carrots or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I later came to find out that **G** had made snide comments to **C** about how useless and incompetent the staff were. If there was one person who was more protective of us servers than **M,** it was **C**. He had been in the industry for decades, and had owned several restaurants, and understood the importance of having a positive relationship between BOH and FOH. He also had a temper.

&amp;#x200B;

**G** continued to chew out the dining room staff for the rest of her tour. I only know this because our dining room manager (**M**'s boss) pulled me aside to ask what happened, because the Marketing director had gotten an earful from **G**, and Marketing had gone to the dining room manager about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, **GM** did not move into the facility, and nothing else every came of this fiasco. It was, however, the most emotionally trying shift of my life. I had taken a lot of shit from the residents--they were old and entitled and didn't understand that we had multiple people to serve at once--but the way that this woman spoke to me broke me inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this isn't nearly as bad as what many people in this sub have experienced, but it was something I felt fit here pretty nicely. Thought I might share.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: gluten free gremlin kicks up a fuss about us not having a gluten free menu; makes two servers and a manager cry.",t2_2kd1c1id,False,,0,False,Gluten Free Gremlin,[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ewi8o5,False,dark,,public,32,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,32,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1580470995.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been hanging out here for a while, but this is my first post. For context, I&amp;#39;m a waitress in the dining room of an independent living retirement facility. I&amp;#39;ve worked there for three and a half years now, which means that I&amp;#39;m the server with the most experience. This will be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: little old me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: Former Manager (he was my manager at the time that this took place)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OS: Other Server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G: the aforementioned gluten free gremlin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM: the Gremlin&amp;#39;s mother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C: Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, at this retirement community, we do tours for people who are inquiring about moving into the facility. The people touring are often accompanied by their children. As a part of this tour, they are invited to have lunch in our dining room. Because I have the most experience at this place, I end up taking most of the tours, in order to make sure they get the best service, because we want these people to move into the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the marketing director brings in the tour in the middle of lunch service. It was a pretty slow day, so I was in a really good mood, and I was almost finished with the two other tables that had been in my section. I also generally enjoyed serving the tours, because usually they were lovely (more polite than most of the actual residents, that was for sure). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get them sat down, with menus, and I bring them water. I do the standard &amp;quot;hi my name&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; and I&amp;#39;ll be your server today, can I get you two anything else to drink today, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And right off the bat, I can tell that &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; is going to be a problem. She looked me dead in the eyes and said &amp;quot;where is your gluten-free menu?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I don&amp;#39;t believe we have one. I can certainly go speak to our chef, though, to determine which items are gluten-free&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: I&amp;#39;ve worked in restaurants for a while, and had had a long-term boyfriend with Celiac&amp;#39;s, so I was pretty familiar with what gluten free meant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G,&lt;/strong&gt; in the snarkiest way you can imagine: &amp;quot;Well, that sounds like more of a hassle than it&amp;#39;s worth. Why don&amp;#39;t you have a gluten-free menu?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me,&lt;/strong&gt; heartrate rising, because I could &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt; the karen on this woman&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;To my knowledge, we haven&amp;#39;t had more than one or two gluten-free residents in the past few years. I don&amp;#39;t think that my managers have ever felt that a gluten-free menu was necessary, given that fact.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G,&lt;/strong&gt; now speaking as though I&amp;#39;m about 5 years old&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;well, now, I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s quite true, especially in today&amp;#39;s day and age. Everyone&amp;#39;s got something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: calling me a liar is the easiest way to get on my bad side. I know this dining room like the back of my hand, I know each and every resident that eats in my dining room, and I know if they have any restrictions, because dining restrictions show up in our POS. I&amp;#39;m also not stupid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Other side note: perhaps, in &amp;#39;today&amp;#39;s day and age&amp;#39;, everyone does have something. However, recall that the age group that I serve in my dining room is, like, anywhere from 65 to 100+ years old. In that generation, very few people have &lt;em&gt;got something&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;, trying to keep calm, because these are guests: &amp;quot;like I said earlier, I can certainly go check with the chef for you, to figure out what your mom can eat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and at that point, that&amp;#39;s all I could do. I don&amp;#39;t know the ins and outs of every recipe on the menu. I don&amp;#39;t work in the kitchen, so, while I could have taken a pretty good guess, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be perfect)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;, with the most patronizing smile, acid in her voice: &amp;quot;okay, clearly you&amp;#39;re not understanding what gluten-free means. It depends on the way that the food is cooked, and so we can&amp;#39;t just go through the menu item by item in order to determine what is or isn&amp;#39;t gluten-free. So, why don&amp;#39;t you do your job, and tell me what on this menu my mother can eat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never bitten my tongue that hard in my life. I swear I saw red. I could feel myself growing closer and closer to tears, and I knew that I needed to get away from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me,&lt;/strong&gt; forcing a smile: &amp;quot;well, I&amp;#39;ll go talk to the chef and see what we can do for you, okay?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked away from that table, as quickly as I could. As soon as I got back to the kitchen, I went and found &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;. I told him that I needed someone else to take that table, and that I was no longer going to be serving them, because I would not deal with someone who talked to me like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other servers (&lt;strong&gt;OS&lt;/strong&gt;) heard me half-crying, half-speaking, and offered to take the table. She spoke to the chef, then went out in the dining room, and allegedly, the following interaction took place (I was in the break room, trying to calm down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OS:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;hi, my name is &lt;strong&gt;OS,&lt;/strong&gt; and there are a couple of things we can arrange that are gluten-free--&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;oh, finally, someone who knows what they&amp;#39;re talking about. Hopefully you&amp;#39;re more competent than that other girl&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OS:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;I apologize if you felt that way about your other server; however, we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of experience serving gluten-free guests, as we haven&amp;#39;t had that many in the past.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G,&lt;/strong&gt; progressively more furious and condescending&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;You know what, I take back what I said. Clearly you and your coworkers have no idea what gluten-free means, or how many people it affects. There are so many people who can&amp;#39;t have gluten, I can&amp;#39;t imagine that you&amp;#39;ve never had one here. And, like I explained to that &lt;em&gt;other girl&lt;/em&gt;, we can&amp;#39;t just look at the menu and decide what&amp;#39;s gluten-free, it has to be prepared in a special way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OS&lt;/strong&gt; didn&amp;#39;t say anything else before she walked away. &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; was the next victim of the table, and &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; pulled him aside to chew him out about how awful his servers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: when I say pulled him aside, I mean she pulled him away from the table. Into the middle of the dining room. Within earshot of every server. And the remaining residents in the dining room.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; spent about 10 minutes informing &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; about how awful service had been, how terribly she and her mother had been treated, and how incompetent &lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;OS&lt;/strong&gt; were. She didn&amp;#39;t understand this generation (referring to &lt;strong&gt;OS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;I--&lt;/strong&gt;and, by extension, almost every other server in the place) could be so lazy and useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, something to know is that &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; was fiercely protective of his team. We were, for all intents and purposes, a very tight knit family, and he was everyone&amp;#39;s Work-Dad. Furthermore, he had the worst temper of anyone that I&amp;#39;ve ever met. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll make another post about him sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; stormed back into the kitchen, with literal steam coming out of his ears. Also crying. At this point, &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; volunteered to take the table. Funnily enough, &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; was perfectly pleasant to &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; (because she knew he&amp;#39;d be the one making her food).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; came back to the kitchen, he informed us that &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt; had several other dietary restrictions that we hadn&amp;#39;t been informed about. She couldn&amp;#39;t eat pork or fish or beef. She couldn&amp;#39;t eat green vegetables. No gluten. No seasoning. This resulted in the blandest looking dish I had ever seen--if I recall correctly, it was a plainer than plain chicken breast, with a side of carrots or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I later came to find out that &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; had made snide comments to &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; about how useless and incompetent the staff were. If there was one person who was more protective of us servers than &lt;strong&gt;M,&lt;/strong&gt; it was &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;. He had been in the industry for decades, and had owned several restaurants, and understood the importance of having a positive relationship between BOH and FOH. He also had a temper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; continued to chew out the dining room staff for the rest of her tour. I only know this because our dining room manager (&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s boss) pulled me aside to ask what happened, because the Marketing director had gotten an earful from &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;, and Marketing had gone to the dining room manager about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt; did not move into the facility, and nothing else every came of this fiasco. It was, however, the most emotionally trying shift of my life. I had taken a lot of shit from the residents--they were old and entitled and didn&amp;#39;t understand that we had multiple people to serve at once--but the way that this woman spoke to me broke me inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn&amp;#39;t nearly as bad as what many people in this sub have experienced, but it was something I felt fit here pretty nicely. Thought I might share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’ve posted a few times before. I’m a bartender in a place that gets a lot of weekly regulars, and they are sort of like VIPs at our place so they get special pricing/discounts on certain things. One of these things is that they pay less for a soda, and get free refills for it.  One guy, Dave, is hard for me to read but never gives me any trouble. He always opens a tab and when it’s time to close out, he always asks me to do it for him. Our POS is on an iPad kind of device. So he’ll have me enter the tip for him (he tells me how much to enter) and to sign for him. He always tips about an average and appropriate amount which I appreciate. Last week for whatever reason, he told me “whatever 20% is, double it”. I was surprised but thanked him profusely. 

After closing out he ordered a soda. This guy never skips out on his tab, so when I told him it would be $ and he brushed me off and kept chatting with the other customers at the bar (this is not unusual) I wasn’t worried and I knew he’d pay me before leaving. Come time for him to leave, he says goodnight to me and says “you were just kidding about the $ right?” I told him I was not kidding, wondering if he was joking. Nope. He starts making a big fuss about the fact that I’m charging him. “I thought we got free sodas?” I said “You get free refills, but the first one is at a discount for you guys.” Then he continues making a fuss “THATS the price with the discount?? That’s ridiculous, that’s so much for a soda, I can’t believe you’re charging me for that.” 

I’m leaving out a lot of fluff because he really just kept going on and on. I felt my face getting red, I’m not good with confrontation and didn’t know what to say so I said “I’m just doing my job”. The part that bothered me most is what he said next: “I can’t believe this, I just tipped you 40%!!” I was really offended. For one thing, I never *ask* for tips and I certainly don’t ask for certain amounts. Nobody forced him to give me a 40% tip. Now he was making me feel bad about the tip he gave me, ranting at me for the prices which I don’t even have any control over, and berating me for literally doing my job. 

What really gets me is the way he said that last part. Was he insinuating that because he was such an amazing guy to give me such a big tip that I should give him things for free? Or what, use part of that tip to buy his soda? If it was such a big deal that he didn’t spend any more money why didn’t he just tip less and use that for his soda? I’m telling this story because tonight is his regular night and I’m apprehensive. I know it’s not the biggest deal in the world and he never did give me any trouble before, but I do know he’s a ball buster. I just want to put that little incident behind me and not have him poke fun at me for what happened when I was just doing my job.

Edit: To the redditors telling me I should have just bought the drink and I should buy my regulars drinks sometimes, you’re absolutely right and I do indeed do this from time to time. I love my job, I love my customers, and I try my best to take care of them and let them know I genuinely enjoy seeing them and I’m not just interested in a tip. 

If I was really so bad in this scenario then that really bothers me and there’s unfortunately nothing I can do about it now. The reason I shared this is because I was upset and embarrassed, standing there for so long getting yelled at by somebody who I do my best to take care of every week.

,TalesFromYourServer," 

This is my first post and I thought I would tell about a real incident that happened to me a couple of weeks ago. I was able to write it down after I got home from work, have taken some deep breaths, and had a soft drink at my elbow.

I was at work. I man the front line at a fast food establishment. We can call it Arewethereyet. An elderly gentleman comes in, not moving easily and on oxygen. I want to help him as best I can, so I greet him with my best personal relations smile and ask what he would like to order. He informs me that he has a coupon for a twofer special but he left it in his car. Did he HAVE to go back and get it? I sadly and politely told him that we didn't have any coupons out right now...The ones that he was thinking of had all expired a few weeks before and so were removed from the register. As a side note, we don't put in any prices at all on the register. We just hit the button for the item and it has a price already on it. When we have coupons or sales, there's a separate button with the sale price on it. Once the sale is over, the button is gone and so is the price.

Anyway, he irately told me that he DID have the coupon and it was good! I tried to be polite and said maybe it was a coupon from another area. There ARE those from the same chain for different areas and we DO honor them, but we have to see them to know what to ring up and then we keep the coupon to show what the open discount was for. He interrupted me as I tried to explain, telling me that he WAS from this area and he was going to go to his car to get that coupon and shove it up my a\*\*.

That did it. Any wish to assist him just flew out of the window, towing my temper close behind it. At that point, I just told him that he needed to leave right now.

That was it. I had had it. When I saw that he was coming back in, I listened to the screaming in my mind that I NEEDED to make sure I kept this job and didn't get in trouble, so I let my manager deal with him. I had told her while he left what he had said and how he'd said it threateningly so she went to the front to meet with him. I just decided that I would walk off to a different area of the restaurant while he was there. Needless to say, the coupon that he flashed in her face WAS expired. She pointed that out to him. ""Well, you were right."" He said over Boss's shoulder to me as I was getting almost out of his sight. No apology. Just a shrug of 'Oh well"". He asked how much the regular price of the items were, but didn't like the non-coupon price, so he left without ordering.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Just wanted to share a story about a party I got. This was 3 years ago, I was working at a bar/restaurant in a small downtown. I was getting ready and at about 3:30 4 people came in (we opened at 4, but the GM wanted us so seat them anyways). I asked them how many there would be and they looked at each other and said “probably about 50?” And I laughed and said “so 4 then?” But they were not joking. I was the only server until 5. No reservation, Saturday night. My manager was upset, and they said they did not know that the restaurant had changed owners, they came the first weekend in December every year and the previous restaurant knew this. So I took them. It was a large group of people that had all worked together years ago and were retired. It ended up being around 65 people, all separate tabs. I took it completely by myself, and they were so kind, patient, and fun. The GM at this time was the worst, and constantly was trying to skimp me out on tables and parties because he didn’t like me. The 2 hosts came in the next night to tell him how great I did and how happy everyone was with my service. He of course never mentioned this to me, and somehow took credit for my service, but they told me. They came in the next year and asked for me and I did it again. This last year, I didn’t even work at this restaurant anymore, and they begged the new manager to call me and get me to come back. I looooved this party, not only because I made bank, but I genuinely had a good time working it. I was on a first name basis with almost all of them, and could chat with them while I was working.

The restaurant just closed down, and I might just stick a note on the door for them next December letting them know that I appreciated them, and maybe recommend the bar down the block. 
Just wanted to share a positive experience that came out of something that started off very unplanned, chaotic, and overwhelming :)&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Some quick background:

For the past several months I've been working 6 days a week between two restaurants. Aside from them both being independently owned, they are very different establishments.

The first place is fast casual Italian for families; the prices are super cheap and it's all about fast table times, it's ALWAYS insanely busy.

The other is a high-end wine bar with tapas. It's slower paced with very high standards of service but crazy money.

The Regular from the Italian Restaurant:

Matthew is the type to order the cheapest dish with a water &amp; coffee, and proceed to sit at the bar for hours. What bothers me is his need to talk non-stop and even interrupt. I will be polite and chat with him briefly during downtime, but I normally have a 10 table section. A lot of the time I just have to ignore him.

Several of the other servers have mentioned being a little weirded out by him, but he's never actually done anything creepy. 

Now to the issue:

So I've mentioned my other restaurant job in passing; it's in another part of the city (not too far, but in a different neighborhood). 

Last week, out of the blue he shows up at my other job in the middle of our rush. He starts talking about how he hasn't seen me at the restaurant in a while so he came looking for me. He was adamant to know when my next shift was. He wasn't coming in to the restaurant to eat or anything. My manager noticed I was a little weirded out and came over to intercept. 

I was creeped out and uncomfortable. He's twice my age (I'm a female in my 20s). It's not like we've shared any in depth conversations, nor have I treated him any differently than another customer.



TL;DR

Regular whom I occasionally serve shows up at my other job looking for me. All because I haven't worked a shift in a while, he then proceeds to basically demand to know when my next shift will be. He's like twice my age (I am a female in my 20s). Made me feel really uncomfortable, but am I overreacting?

&lt;p&gt;Because I have missed jobs for being trans.  They can walk in and get a job. Many jobs won’t hire me because I am trans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’m still here. Making $14 in 6 hours. Because I know my pool is smaller than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I've worked with two such gentlemen:

**1.) Max** \- I worked at this Italian restaurant for literally 2 nights and quit immediately. Why? My first night, I'm getting to know my coworkers and hanging out while it's slow, and she tells me that we have to ""take shifts"" to to watch our supervisor, Max. I thought it was really weird, but when Max went outside for ""a smoke"", I was told that the iPhone we had up on a shelf near the counter (we were at an establishment where you paid at the counter and we brought your food to you) was to have its camera left on and not be moved to watch Max at the register because he regularly stole tips and cash from the drawer. It was known by all my coworkers and the kitchen staff, and it was known by management, but he must have known someone higher up or something, because he still had a job. 

If that wasn't weird enough, he always seemed very tense... very shifty... One day, he came back in and reeked of... plastic? It was a weird, synthetic scent. I'd never smelled it before in person, but I immediately knew it was meth based on descriptions my SO had given me (his brother used to be an addict). This dude was a meth addict who regularly stole from our register, and regularly took smoke breaks... to smoke meth. Even smelling him made me feel sick, and I asked the same co-worker if that's what he was doing, and she confirmed that for me. He even went outside one day to greet someone in a black van and talked with him outside for a good while... a dealer maybe? Idk, but that was more than enough to make me quit. I wasn't getting paid enough to keep a drug addict from stealing all of our tips every night. Like, I legit couldn't go to the bathroom if it was just me and Max at the register.

**2.) Donald** \- *Far* less serious than Max, but I worked at a Cracker Barrel, and this guy Donald came off as this super sweet old man. Goofy, made dad/grandpa jokes, was super friendly, etc. But then a coworker pulled me aside during my first week and told me to watch myself around him, but more importantly, to watch my tips... I knew she was right when most of the staff left work with $16-20 in tips one night, but somehow Donald had made around $200. He claimed that he was just a ""favorite"" by customers, but I knew better. Over time, that cutesy old man demeanor dropped away, because if you even stood near his tips for too long, he'd get kinda nasty.

,TalesFromYourServer," TL;DR: The house was over booked, kitchen got backed up hella hard. Entire table’s order came out cold. Manager was nowhere to be found. Insanity ensued. Karen said I didn’t do enough and didn’t care.
Narrator: *But he did*


Last night was a crazy night. There were tons conventions in town so the hotels around us were packed. I get called in, no problem cuz I like money. Immediately get hit with a 16 top and a 4 top. No problem there either, until... 3 hours later and 4 of the 16 are still there. Smack dab in the middle of the section, backing up the next reservation that was suppose to be there. The house is fully packed. No other place to put the other large reservations. 

Side note, 268+ reservations between 6pm-8pm. Logistically speaking, management failed in that aspect. 

The 12 top that is suppose to be on that table ends up waiting close too 2 hours for their table while they drink at the bar. Failure #2. 

The whole house is stilled packed when they take their seats. 

I go through my spiel and acknowledge that I know that they’ve been waiting for a while and I know they are hungry/ornery so I immediately turn 60% of my attention to them. 40% on my other two tables who I fear suffered because of what transpired. But they weren’t lacking, I had help from my coworkers.

Apps come out, their drinks are constantly replenished, all seems fine. Until I check my watch, their entrees should’ve come out by now right? Nah, homie. They hadn’t. The kitchen was starting to feel the affects of the logistical mess at the front door. Failure #3

At this point, it was close to 9:30ish and I was circling the expo line. As the food was being prepared to be transported to the table, the host finds me and tells me that they are standing up like fucking lemurs for their food. But it’s all good, I have it in my hands. Everyone gets their food and I get a sense of momentary tranquility. Shattered by the ominous hand up in the air.

Fuck.

Karen is asking for the manager, while everyone is about two, three bites into their meals. 

I tell her “Of course, is everything alright?” 
Karen: “No, you’ve been great, but all our food came out cold.”
Every. Single. Dish.
Failure #4

*FUCK*

But they’re hungry, they’re eating. My options are severely limited. I rush to find a manager in this huge 14,000 sq f restaurant (Split between up and downstairs). But before that happens, the other guests ask me to get them a couple sauces and some salt/pepper. Absolutely no problem, but my priority is finding that god damned manager. I searched and searched by the time I found him I forgot the sauces. And all the salt/pepper are being used. And they’re done with their meals. Failure #5 *Sad server noise*

Karen and the manager are going at it like Gandalf and the Balrog. Turns out Karen and pals had booked an event. Had a card on file. Her party was a banquet event order with the sales team for a private event. No one relayed that info to me, which is important because they had a deposit. They could’ve had important details related to food and what not. Failure #6

Karen and the manager finally came to an amicable solution I suppose that I wasn’t privy too. Manger tells me all is well and she doesn’t want a discount or anything because she owned several restaurants and knows the game and that I was a great sever, blah blah blah. Ok......

Now I’m so embarrassed. I take pride in my level of service. I wished I could’ve traversed the fabric of reality into another dimension. Lay upon the Earth and let the grass reclaim me. I don’t want to show my face to the guests level of embarrassment. Ashamed of my restaurant because this is not an isolated event.

The night ends with several pints of alcohol. And in the morning, the events that took place would be a memory and a lesson.

Until.... Karen calls the restaurant complaining about what happened. And rightfully so. But her angry also swept me away. She claims that I didn’t care. I didn’t do enough. 

Madam, if you only knew how much I cared, you would never say that. If I hadn’t cared, I still would’ve put that 20% auto grat onto the bill. If I didn’t care I wouldn’t feel on the edge of screaming at the kitchen. Shot myself on the foot with that one mates, the tab was close to $900. But it didn’t feel right to me.

Entire table’s order came out cold. Manager was nowhere to be found. Insanity ensued. Karen said I didn’t do enough and didn’t care.
Narrator: &lt;em&gt;But he did&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was a crazy night. There were tons conventions in town so the hotels around us were packed. I get called in, no problem cuz I like money. Immediately get hit with a 16 top and a 4 top. No problem there either, until... 3 hours later and 4 of the 16 are still there. Smack dab in the middle of the section, backing up the next reservation that was suppose to be there. The house is fully packed. No other place to put the other large reservations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note, 268+ reservations between 6pm-8pm. Logistically speaking, management failed in that aspect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12 top that is suppose to be on that table ends up waiting close too 2 hours for their table while they drink at the bar. Failure #2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole house is stilled packed when they take their seats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go through my spiel and acknowledge that I know that they’ve been waiting for a while and I know they are hungry/ornery so I immediately turn 60% of my attention to them. 40% on my other two tables who I fear suffered because of what transpired. But they weren’t lacking, I had help from my coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps come out, their drinks are constantly replenished, all seems fine. Until I check my watch, their entrees should’ve come out by now right? Nah, homie. They hadn’t. The kitchen was starting to feel the affects of the logistical mess at the front door. Failure #3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was close to 9:30ish and I was circling the expo line. As the food was being prepared to be transported to the table, the host finds me and tells me that they are standing up like fucking lemurs for their food. But it’s all good, I have it in my hands. Everyone gets their food and I get a sense of momentary tranquility. Shattered by the ominous hand up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen is asking for the manager, while everyone is about two, three bites into their meals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell her “Of course, is everything alright?” 
Karen: “No, you’ve been great, but all our food came out cold.”
Every. Single. Dish.
Failure #4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUCK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they’re hungry, they’re eating. My options are severely limited. I rush to find a manager in this huge 14,000 sq f restaurant (Split between up and downstairs). But before that happens, the other guests ask me to get them a couple sauces and some salt/pepper. Absolutely no problem, but my priority is finding that god damned manager. I searched and searched by the time I found him I forgot the sauces. And all the salt/pepper are being used. And they’re done with their meals. Failure #5 &lt;em&gt;Sad server noise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen and the manager are going at it like Gandalf and the Balrog. Turns out Karen and pals had booked an event. Had a card on file. Her party was a banquet event order with the sales team for a private event. No one relayed that info to me, which is important because they had a deposit. They could’ve had important details related to food and what not. Failure #6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen and the manager finally came to an amicable solution I suppose that I wasn’t privy too. Manger tells me all is well and she doesn’t want a discount or anything because she owned several restaurants and knows the game and that I was a great sever, blah blah blah. Ok......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m so embarrassed. I take pride in my level of service. I wished I could’ve traversed the fabric of reality into another dimension. Lay upon the Earth and let the grass reclaim me. I don’t want to show my face to the guests level of embarrassment. Ashamed of my restaurant because this is not an isolated event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night ends with several pints of alcohol. And in the morning, the events that took place would be a memory and a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until.... Karen calls the restaurant complaining about what happened. And rightfully so. But her angry also swept me away. She claims that I didn’t care. I didn’t do enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madam, if you only knew how much I cared, you would never say that. If I hadn’t cared, I still would’ve put that 20% auto grat onto the bill. If I didn’t care I wouldn’t feel on the edge of screaming at the kitchen. Shot myself on the foot with that one mates, the tab was close to $900. But it didn’t feel right to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go in at 5 today, hopefully I won’t get shit for what happened. But if I do, I’ll post an update.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I'm not a server of any kind, but I used to be a waitress. I am a teacher now, and tonight my sister, my mother, and I all went out to dinner at this Asian restaurant/takeout place where one of my best students works, and she was our server. When she was bringing out our food, she was carrying the plates and drinks on a giant circular tray. We could see her from across the restaurant, and she was doing a great job until she got about arm's distance away from our table when she all of the sudden slipped forward, both feet going out from under her at the same time, classic cartoon style. I thought for sure she was going to get the food and drinks everywhere and braced myself for a face full of lo mein and a shower of hot tea when she lifts up the tray and sets it on the table AS SHE IS FALLING. Like, her entire body is slipping forwards, but she still manages to lift up the tray and set it down quite neatly on the table. A half a second later she was on the floor, face down in the starfish position. Not a single drop of a drink was spilled nor a single piece of food out of place. It looked like she set it down that way on purpose. A second later she popped back up and was profusely apologizing while we all just stared at her amazed. She offered us free desserts as an apology and we told her that she didn't have to apologize but she still got us free desserts and refills. Well, amazing act number two was when my sister went to ask for some more ice, she went to hand the cup out to her but dropped it before she even had the chance to grab it. Well, what does my student do? SHOOTS OUT HER FOOT SIDEWAYS AND CATCHES THE CUP ON HER FOOT! She casually said, ""Oops! None of that, thank you."" in a very cheery tone. Amazing act number three came when she proceeded to KICK HER FOOT STRAIGHT UP AND CATCH THE CUP MID-AIR! She didn't spill a single drop of it either! She then turned to my sister (also a teacher at the same school as me) and joked, ""You know, Mrs. \_\_\_\_\_, if you wanted some more ice, you could have just asked."" Throughout the rest of the night, I saw her balancing plates up to her biceps and balance a giant tray on her head.

I'm seriously convinced that my student is an acrobat and I plan to see how many textbooks she can balance on her head tomorrow. Hands down the best server ever.

UPDATE: My class didn't end up doing any work today as we just played coordination games with the student. The student was able to balance four textbooks on her head before she said that her neck started hurting. We got 7 small hardback books on her head though and she walked the length of the room with no issue and said she had to go to the bathroom. Her sister dared her to go to the bathroom with the books still on her head and followed her in there. She managed to go to the bathroom without losing the books. We also balanced bottles of water on her feet and she very slowly walked the length of the room without losing either water bottle.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work as a cashier/waiter at a privately owned fast food place that has aspirations of being an a la carte restaurant (the owner really doesn't understand where most of the sales come from i.e. drunks just wanting to stuff their faces). Since I only work during busy nights, mostly Fri-Sat and Sat-Sun, I see a fair share of drunken stupidity, but last Fri-Sat was something special. What follows are the ""highlights"":

I'm handling the cash register and the tables while my friend/colleague handles the food. This is how we usually divide duties, since she doesn't want to deal with the customers and I don't want to deal with oven and fryer.

Generally speaking it's a quiet night. But then, a bit before 3 a.m. shit starts flying at the fan and our card reader goes on the frizz. No transactions will go through. Great, while that's out of commission, I have to ask every customer if they're able pay with cash or not. Most are fine with the request and either produce cash or pop out to the nearest ATM.

Then in stumbles Drunk #1 who, apart from just being generally incoherent, wants to order a dish we don't serve (a variety platter that a local bar serves). I tell him we don't have that dish, Local Bar has it. We can make part of the variety dish, but we can't recreate it. I ask him, if he wants the portion of the dish that we can make, and he appears to want it. When I further explain that he'll have to pay with cash because the card reader isn't working, he digs up 20€ (the portion we could do would've been around 49€, it's a big platter). I tell him that he needs 29€ more, to which he essentially tosses the 20 at my colleague and storms off. Colleague tries to call him back to take his money, but he either doesn't hear or care. One of our regulars sees this and is ready to vouch for us that we tried to give the 20 back. Ah well, the 20 goes in our tip jar (NOTE: in my country tips are not required/expected).

Next comes a regular, Belligerent Dolt. Half of the time BD is fine, but other times he's picking fights with other people in line. When I inform BD and his friends that they'll have to pay with cash and that we can't start making their orders before they're paid, BD cusses colleague and I out, claiming he ""brings so much money into this place"". Like, buddy, even if you were one of our nice regulars, we still wouldn't make your order before you paid. You're usually just too drunk to realize that fact. BD and co go to the ATM and eventually pay, while BD continues to whine. Their combined order was around 80€, so yeah, no way were we going to risk a no show by making the order before hand.

Then there's a middle aged couple who clearly didn't read the menu properly, but that's not a surprise. Frankly, the set up of our menu is confusing. 

When it's finally 5 a.m. and we're ready to close, colleague tells me that a customers is sleeping in one of the tables. We try to wake her up, but she' barely reacting. So I call emergency services so that they can either send the cops or the EMTs over. While waiting for the ambulance I have to monitor her breathing, so I can't get cleanup started on time. At this point colleague is still finishing the last orders to go. 

While the EMTs show up and help her out, another customer, Drunk #2, is passed out drunk, leaning against a side table. Both colleague and I order him to leave, but no dice, guy's not budging though he is reacting. Colleague is lucky enough to flag down a cop car driving by, so eventually Drunk #2 gets escorted out. 

Once all the orders are done and all the customers are out, colleague and I proceed to groan and be baffled at the last few hours we had. It took us till 6:30 to clean the place up, since the horde of Distractions kept us away from prepping the cleanup like we usually would.

Oh and both Drunk #1 and Belligerent Dolt showed up the next night and didn't say a word of the previous night's events. Colleague and I came to the conclusion that either they were too drunk to remember or too embarrassed to bring their issues back up.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I'm not sure this is the proper subreddit, but....This happened a few years ago and is slightly different than most stories because its not a complaint about customers, but more an oversight by an drunk boss. Anyway.....

I started a job as a line cook at a fairly popular bar near a college campus. I had prior experience as a line cook so it wasn't all totally new. It was a bar that served typical bar food: pizza, wings, burger, and the like. There are 2-3 in the kitchen at once that handle everything from food prep to dishes. 

My first night was a weeknight and not to crazy. I got a brief introduction on how everything worked and the basics on how the equipment worked. My second night which was a Friday I was supposed to work with the same guy, but he got fired or didn't show up. So I was alone. 

I had no idea what most of the sandwiches were because I never frequented the place before getting hired. All the bartenders/servers were half drunk and no help by 6:00. So I grabbed a menu and tried to make the food by the description. I had to make pizzas and had never done that before. I didn't know what sizes were what. How long to cook anything. It was a nightmare. And being Friday night it was packed. 

I made it through somehow. I came in the next day on Saturday for the lunch shift. It was college football season so the place was again packed. This time another cook showed up and left me to do all the prep for the day while he got hammered with the servers before we opened. (He was a nice fellow and offered me some of his crystal meth to smoke when we had a break.  I declined) So I ended up cooking alone again and luckily these drunk people were happy drunks and didn't complain about much. 

I ended up working there for 2 years and it turned out to be a very fun job. Looking back on it now I'm not sure how I put up with all I did. I don't drink so I was generally left as the only sober person in the building including the drunk staff. Owner was in there constantly hammered. I ended up getting fired because they hired a guy to manage the place and he felt I didn't respect or listen to him (I didn't).

,TalesFromYourServer,"For some reason yesterday, my coworker and I had a swarm of creepy guys craving pizza. 

My first table was this old guy that looks like a coke-addicted music producer from the 80’s. Turtleneck, gold chain and everything. When I’d talk to him, he’d do this creepy smile and rub his thighs staring deep into my soul. His eyes followed me like the Mona Lisa whenever I was doing things behind the counter. YIKES! 

After him, quite a few male customers were getting a bit too comfortable with me. I don’t want to get into much detail except to say that I’m nice to you because it’s my job. 

The kicker was this last creep that was sitting at the bar. I had him. My coworker was already wary of his predatory vibes as she has had him before. For a whole hour, he refused to eat food and just kept watching her and me. He just sipped his Yuengling and watched me whenever I was wiping booths. I finally had his ass transferred to my friend because he wouldn’t order. He didn’t even order until I was finishing my sidework. Though while I was doing my sidework, he’d attempt to small talk me. At this point I ignored him. 

For this experience, our managers had a close eye on him. They’ve seen him here before creeping. They saw/ heard us talking about how uncomfortable we were. When this 42 year old dude finally left, he wrote on my SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD friend’s ticket that she was hot. 

First off, it’s clear she’s 17. She asks me to get her beer. Second off, we are there to serve. Not to be objectified. I’m not going to sleep with you just because you tipped $5. I’m worth $6 thank you very much. 

But seriously, it’s tiring with how much sexualizing we deal with. I want to work for my tip being a waitress, not some eye candy. And as for my underaged friend, it really scares me the most seeing her in those situations. She’s still a child. I can’t imagine what that man was thinking while writing that simple, but disgusting thing on her ticket. This is such a common problem and it needs to be resolved.

Maybe it was just me, but, some of their responses to my presence reinforced this for me.

I returned with their drinks on a tray as that is how that restaurant liked their food and beverages brought out. I also arranged my drinks on the tray as to where they would go once at the table.

With three steps, still, to reach their table, the wife sees me. She reaches out and says, ""Oh, here! I got it.""

My front of house staff are too busy serving outside tables that they're forgetting to serve customers that are inside as well. I'm trying my best to direct my floor staff and serve on the floor and I take a couple's order who waited a few minutes too long to be served. Shit happens, I think to myself. Well I did not expect it to turn into such a shitshow. This couple I served start giving me nasty looks from across the floor and I go over to reassure them their food won't be too long and we are busy, we only have two cooks on, should only be ten more minutes. They're scowling at me like I've just eaten their first born in front of them.
Five minutes pass by and I go to assure them they're up next and I'm told by the wife that ""well we ordered before them why don't we have ours yet??"" I look over to a table with just milkshakes and I tell her ""they only have drinks ma'am that's why they have theirs, but yours won't be long""
""We've been waiting over 40 minutes, this is unacceptable""
So I go to the kitchen to try and hurry it along but I was shocked, had it really been that long?? 
I check the time on the docket, it had been twenty minutes since they ordered. Just. 
So I went over and said
""Yours is up next guys, I took your order at 1.25 and it's 1.48 now so it's been twenty minutes and it won't be far away."" 
The woman LOST IT at me for saying this. 
""HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT, WEVE BEEN HERE WAITING FOR FORTY MINUTES""
I'm like, um ma'am it hasn't been forty minutes, but don't worry I've bumped up your order so it'll be next. 
Well she got up, yelling at me that I was rude and she couldn't believe my attitude and left. Her food was literally about to be taken out...

I just wanted her to know that it had been twenty so she could realise it was a normal amount of time that had passed, not because I was trying to be a smartass. Anyways, I had a lil cry in the office and kept pushing on. Man I really wish people could understand how much they hurt you when they treat you like a turd on their shoe.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I'm a server at sushi place in an Asian shopping center. Since the majority of our customers are Asian, and we have maybe 6 people max working at a time, it's fairly authentic and straightforward. Most people know what they want, and just want friendly, professional service. 

Now I've encountered my fair share of entitled folks in other serving jobs, but only in diners and other ""familiar"" American places. At this point I'm kinda baffled as to why Karen-types venture out of TGIChilibees, because any kind of ""foreign"" food seems to upset them and provoke their behavior worse than anywhere I've ever served before. Yesterday, I had two ladies come in for lunch (L1 and L2). They're giving off automatic cranky vibes, but that's cool, I'll just try and be extra positive. 

I go over to introduce myself, and they don't even skip a beat before flying into Karen mode. I get their iced teas, extra extra lemon, light ice. Come back for orders. L1 orders chicken teriyaki. We don't serve teriyaki, it's nowhere on the menu. No, we can't make it special for you, we don't even have a grill back there. So L1 is pissed, sighs, orders cali roll and udon soup. I'm the ONLY server/busser/cashier and L2 orders a shit ton of nigiri and decides to play a very aggressive round of 20 questions with me. If ya'll serve ya'll know- not honest questions to get answers, questions like they're trying to prove you wrong or catch you lying. 
  L2 (points at condiments): ""What's this?""
Me: ""That's eel sauce. It's like sweet teriyaki, it's used for cooking eel.""
L2: ""Is there eel in it?""
Me: ""No ma'am, it's just commonly served on eel""
L2: ""I JUST DON'T want to eat eel""
Me: ""It has no eel in it ma'am.""
L1: ""Well then why is it called eel sauce then?""

Like babygirl, I promise on my life I'm not trying to sneak anything by you. We're not debating, I'm just trying to help you. This weird questioning goes on for everything from the tea flavors to the Japanese menu terms to the exact hotness of hot sake, and I end up weeded on what should be a chill day because of all the extra demands from just them.
   
When they're finished, I notice there's a few half eaten items, ask if they want a box, hope it's not a complaint. Sweet Baby Jesus, of course it is. They just ""tried some new things and didn't like them"", and want them comped. Corporate places I know hand out comps like candy, but this is family owned and the chef/manager definitely doesn't play that, especially with expensive shit like sushi. It's a small place, so I'm witness to THE most uncomfortable argument between L1,L2 and the chef, while trying to help other guests who are all watching this unfold. Nothing gets comped. I ring them up, they're complaining the whole time about never coming back, and some diet racist shit about the chef being cheap. At least the rest of my tables were absolute peaches :)

,TalesFromYourServer,"Our worst regulars were 2 old ladies who ordered very little, drank only water,  tipped very little. Stayed for way too long. They insulted the female servers more than the guys, but we all hated them.

I saw them pull in and park illegally, in a triangular area painted with the diagonal stripes that was tight between the last legal spot and a low retaining wall. The only reason they fit was because the car in the spot next to it was a small 2-door.

When they're seated they tell me they are in a hurry because they're going to a show. No problem, I'd like them gone ASAP anyway.

Midway through their meal everything was going as usual, and I see through the window that the car next to them was leaving. Suddenly I have a wonderful, terrible idea.

They finish, pay, tip their usual 5%, and head out. I can see them stop in their tracks, walk around their car like there's some magical way to extract it, then storm back in.

Now they're yelling from the hostess station to see if anyone in the place owns the truck. No response. I suggest they they should call an Uber or taxi but they don't have Uber and don't want to spend the money on a taxi.

Eventually it was time to bring out the birthday cake and place it in front of the mother, everyone was taking videos and singing...

,TalesFromYourServer,"To the fat guy who couldn't stop asking me if the steak he just ate was vegan when I was clearing his table:

The first time I said, ""of course, I made it myself""

The second time I said, ""absolutely, for sure. All of our steaks are vegan""

The third time I said, ""what is 'Vegan', an island in the South Pacific?""

I don't have the social capital available to riff that much on a joke that bad. No one laughed, and it was equal parts embarrassing and exhausting. We were short staffed and I had other stuff to do.

I'm going to let everyone in on a secret. Vegans don't care that you eat meat. Meat eaters don't care that you're a vegan. No one gives a shit what anyone else eats except for people who mistake their diet for their identity. These people are a lot rarer than everyone else just eating the food they like. Most people don't try to turn their diet into a crusade. Most people aren't insecure enough to care. If you're a vegan who is annoyed with meat eaters, or worse, a meat eater who is annoyed with vegans, you should really look inward. The problem isn't the diet you think that you're diametrically opposed to, the problem is actually just the people who care what other people eat. If I have a guest with a dietary restriction that's obnoxious, I provide them with delicious food because they're guests. Realistically, I invite them over for food slightly less often than my other friends, but I don't consider their diet an attack on my own lifestyle. That's insane.

But, my enlightened tolerance of vegans and meat eaters doesn't pay my bills. Does anyone got a better response to a militant meat eater who won't stop asking if his steak was vegan no matter how many times I try to riff with his awful joke?",t2_r7256,False,,0,False,"""Is this steak vegan?""",[],r/TalesFromYourServer,False,6,,0,,False,t3_eva67s,False,dark,,public,19,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medium,False,19,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1580268398.0,text,6,,,text,self.TalesFromYourServer,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the fat guy who couldn&amp;#39;t stop asking me if the steak he just ate was vegan when I was clearing his table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I said, &amp;quot;of course, I made it myself&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time I said, &amp;quot;absolutely, for sure. All of our steaks are vegan&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third time I said, &amp;quot;what is &amp;#39;Vegan&amp;#39;, an island in the South Pacific?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the social capital available to riff that much on a joke that bad. No one laughed, and it was equal parts embarrassing and exhausting. We were short staffed and I had other stuff to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to let everyone in on a secret. Vegans don&amp;#39;t care that you eat meat. Meat eaters don&amp;#39;t care that you&amp;#39;re a vegan. No one gives a shit what anyone else eats except for people who mistake their diet for their identity. These people are a lot rarer than everyone else just eating the food they like.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I'm a barista and in our store, we offer stamp cards, similar to Purdys - if you buy 10 drinks, you get the 11th one free. Now, on our cards, it quite clearly states that in two sections, the first, in the last little icon where you stamp, it says "" NEXT DRINK **FREE**!"" and also at the very top of the card, in big bold letters ""BUY 10 DRINK AND GET **NEXT ONE** FREE!"" 

A lady came in today,  headphones in, talking on her phone and starts to order her drinks in Chinese. I softly tell her that I don't understand, and she proceeds to try to order in English. She states that she has a free drink and she rudely demands that I combined her stamp cards together. By her tone of her voice and attitude based on this 2 second interaction, I complied because I knew that she'd cause a scene if I didn't. We usually try not to combine the cards, but in most cases, it depends whose working (I usually combine them for people who are nice haha).

The lady acquired 9 stamps on her stamp card, and she asked me to combine them, which means that she has 10 stamps, therefore the next drink she orders is free. She decides to order two drinks, so she would have to pay for the price of one drink. Since she's redeemed her free drink from the card, I ask her if she wanted to start a new stamp card, I receive the silent nod, and then I give her the new card with one stamp on it. 

Now here, here is where I wish I never asked if she wanted a new card, because she rips her headphones off and loudly demands ""WHY DO I ONLY HAVE ONE STAMP? I SHOULD HAVE TWO"" 

So I start to explain to her that since I combined the cards for her (9 stamp + 1 stamp) it meant that the 11th drink was free since she collected 10 stamps. I'm also pointing to the area where it says this on the card this entire time I'm explaining to her.  

She begins to sigh and raises her voice even more, saying that she should have two stamps since she bought two and that the 10th drink is free (even though it clearly says the next one (11th) one is free) 

I repeat to her again, that she must have 10 stamps on her stamp card to qualify for the free drink, and she fulfilled that requirement by having me combine the stamp cards together. She begins to raise her voice even more, saying that it's ridiculous that that's the rule for the free drink qualification, to which I just show her the card again, pointing to the text that says you must have earned 10 stamps for 1 free drink. 

She sighs super loudly and points at me and utters something I didn't understand in Chinese, probably because she knew I didn't understand Chinese.

,TalesFromYourServer,"The cafe I work at recently replaced our table numbers with those pagers that buzz and flash when the order number is called.  Our cashiers are careful to tell everyone, ""Your number is X, this is your pager, when it flashes green and buzzes, your food will be ready over on this counter.""  Sometimes they even will pick up a pager and demonstrate it.

How hard can those instructions be?  I get it when occasionally people come to the wrong counter, but constantly we get people who completely ignore the buzzer for five, ten, fifteen minutes.

The pager does stop after a minute, but when I'm calling an order, if they don't come right up I will keep entering the number on the remote.  Eventually, I'll have to start shouting the number and what's in the order, and they still don't come up right away.  Sometimes, I'll even have to resort to walking around the dining room, shouting the name from the credit card before they answer.

Frankly, on some busy days, The Wheel is already grousing that orders are stacking up, not paying attention to the little box that says your food is ready, and making me find you doesn't help.

After the order goes out, I'll even check the pager to make sure it works, and usually it does.

Then you get the impatient customers that insist that the order you're calling must be theres, because the little red power light is blinking, even after you demonstrate what a pager going off looks like.

Our cashiers are careful to tell everyone, &amp;quot;Your number is X, this is your pager, when it flashes green and buzzes, your food will be ready over on this counter.&amp;quot;  Sometimes they even will pick up a pager and demonstrate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How hard can those instructions be?  I get it when occasionally people come to the wrong counter, but constantly we get people who completely ignore the buzzer for five, ten, fifteen minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pager does stop after a minute, but when I&amp;#39;m calling an order, if they don&amp;#39;t come right up I will keep entering the number on the remote.  Eventually, I&amp;#39;ll have to start shouting the number and what&amp;#39;s in the order, and they still don&amp;#39;t come up right away.  Sometimes, I&amp;#39;ll even have to resort to walking around the dining room, shouting the name from the credit card before they answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, on some busy days, The Wheel is already grousing that orders are stacking up, not paying attention to the little box that says your food is ready, and making me find you doesn&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the order goes out, I&amp;#39;ll even check the pager to make sure it works, and usually it does.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"last night, one of my managers, my coworkers, and I went to another Japanese restaurant to celebrate one of our BOH worker's birthday (manager was paying for all of us). We went to this restaurant because some of the BOH staff at this restaurant also works at our restaurant, either on a different day or during lunch shift (the restaurant we went to is only open at night, as it is an izakaya place). Our server got us started with water right away...and then it went downhill from there. Our server was nowhere to be seen. Most of the waitstaff were Japanese speakers and my manager, being the only Japanese speaker among us, kept trying to flag down in Japanese for someone to take our orders. Probably 30 minutes had passed at this point. The birthday person asked for coke and one of my coworkers asked for toro sashimi (toro is like the fatty part of a tuna) but both of them never got what they asked for. Nobody ever checked on us. A dish that none of us ordered was put on our table and left there until my manager flagged a server down to tell them (it was a tofu dish and while I'm the only vegetarian there, I **know** that I didn't order it because I actually typed on my phone a small list of what I wanted to order, and tofu was not on that list. Nobody else ordered tofu). One of my coworkers also ordered ramen but instead of asking who ordered ramen or putting it in front of her (provided they use seat numbers but considering it was an izakaya restaurant this is unlikely), they just set the ramen on the edge of the table and left; my coworker had to literally get out of her seat to go grab her bowl of ramen. To put this into perspective, we were sat at a 12-seater table, the only table large enough to accommodate our party. This coworker was sitting at one of the middle seats. She had to get up and walk past me and a few other people to get to the edge of the table where her ramen was and then pass us again to return to her seat. The food was really good but the service, not so much. When I asked for a togo container for one of my food, I also wanted to order desserts (mochi ice cream) but the server (who my manager noted wasn't even the same person who took our food order) just started to walk away after I requested a togo container so I had to loudly say that I also wanted to order desserts in addition to my request for a takeout box. My manager (again, he was paying) didn't even want to leave an additional tip on top of the automatic 18% gratuity because of all that. 

Was my manager in the right to not add an additional tip here? He mentioned that if we had actually gotten service he would've left an additional tip on top of the gratuity but he and my coworkers felt the service was bad. Though because automatic gratuity was added there was no tip line on the receipt (I was sitting across from my manager so I could see what it looked like), just a line to sign your name.

Oh and it was nowhere even close to closing hours...they close at 1am, we arrived at 8pm and left at 10pm.

nice very oldies couple come around every now and then.  i know them from having seen them around, i know they're big spenders.  they have a commerce around.  super nice couple,  they run the 'hat' store in town...  medium business,  but super high class shit.   i've known them from sitting besides them at the bar at another restaurant.  imagine a nice couple in their 70's still in love like the first day.

now it's sunday 5pm and my place is DEAD...  we just had a snowstorm, we're in the deep end of the touristic wave and the locals are just staying home.   and they come in.

there are 3 other customers in the restaurant and i know it's gonna be  very, very long shift.

as i recognize them when they get in the restaurant i just greet them all smiles offer them any table they want...  they pick one..not in my section.

i go to the other server,  tell him all about the fact to take good care of them because i know they're sweethearts and all...  he tells me : dude,  place is dead and you know them..  just take the table.

so i do...  i take care of them..  i know they're big spender but throughout the chit-chat they explain to me how some screwups in our town made them loose a lot of money during the hollidays.  so ever since they always dine in local restaurants, they can't manage to spent as much as they use to.  no worries,   this couple are so nice, friendly and entertaining i don't really care.

and the place is dead,  so i don't have to run around like a madman,  i can just take good care of my customers.  i tell my manager about them...  tell him we need these guys as regulars on those slow winter nights, and tell him i'm gonna send them a nightcap on the house. (been working here for almost 12 years, want none of the responsibilities but still have some power).

i'm taking care of other customers while they leave,  i just run to the coatroom while they're getting dressed to head back home,  shake hands with the gentleman,  kiss the madam,  thank both of them for coming in and tell them it'll be my pleasure to take care of them when they come by....

check: 113$.   they left 150$ in the checkbook.

so i'm also sending some love their way..  if you're a hat entousiast and you pass by quebec city,  stop by  [BIBI](http://www.bibietcie.com/) 

i'm not doing this for shameless publicity,  the amount of ppl it's going to reach is abysmal.  but you know,  they helped me pay my rent,  and know nothing about the InTeRwEbS.

This happened yesterday (Sunday) afternoon, so typical post church crowd shenanigans. This one table seemed very nice except for the dad, off the bat he was demanding to know specific prices and ingredients that he would have found just looking at the menu. Anyway, they get their food, goes great, I check on them like twice cause the dad seemed to dislike when I was the table. At the end I give them their bill and that's when it goes downhill. 

The dad shows me the bottom of his cup is chipped and begins to go on and on about how he just had stitches put on his finger and it could have cut him and injured him. And how his oldest son (who was very quiet and nice) was autistic and could have hurt himself (with the bottom of the dad's cup??? Ok). Bear in mind our cups are a plastic material not glass, and yes it was chipped but wouldn't injure you unless you intentionally pressed it against your skin. I just sighed and brought over the GM who offered him some free appetizer coupons. Wasn't good enough for him apparently. So my pushover manager took off an additional $15.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Yesterday I had a couple with a pretty easy order, fried rice and beef and broccoli. When I checked back after two minutes, they called me over and showed me their fried rice which was raw, gummy, and basically completely inedible. 

I got apologized profusely on the kitchens  behalf and went right away to make another one. Five minutes later, I had a brand new fried rice from the Chef and I brought out an additional beef and broccoli to complement their first one. I let them know that I was worried their beef and broccoli would get cold while they were waiting for their fried rice remake so I brought them a new one. 

As luck would have it , the second fried rice was fucked too. Raw, gummy, basically disgusting to look at. Now I had a to get a manager visit . Fuck

My manager kindly offered them free dessert to go. We also took off the fried rice (obviously) and the cokes off the check. I must’ve apologized about ten times but they were pretty cool about it and let me m know it wasn’t my fault. 

At the end they left me $20 on $45.  Literally made my night and I know we screwed up their fried rice twice so they had every reason to be upset.

If you guys are out there, I just wanna say thanks and you’re the best ❤️

EDIT:

We had two pots of rice and the first one was from the first pot which was definitely no good. But we used the second pot which I thought was better since it was less  gummy. Looking at the second remake it seemed fine but I guess I should’ve actually tasted it with a spoon to make sure it wasn’t like the first one. So I guess I’m partially to blame :(


They also shared a glass and a half of wine as well as an appetizer . I didn’t include that in the story because it didn’t seem relevant. Sorry about that

,TalesFromYourServer,"Okay. It’s a Sunday night. My section is the booths because I’m a closer. I get a four top, it’s two middle-aged couples. 

I greet them. Ask what they would like to drink. The couple on the left starts inquiring about a renewal for our engraved mugs that customers can order and use when they come in. I say I’ll be right back. I go and get the folder with all the info and bring it back. I stand there with the folder for maybe 2-3 minutes as the couple goes back and forth, “Oh I don’t know which one I want. Which one do you want?” Finally the other couple says, “How about we just start with waters.” I’m like jfc. I drop the folder back at the bar, get waters, go back. “Can I get anyone a drink, or are we still deciding?” “Ummm we need more time.” Okay. 

I get other tables—tables that tell me what they want to drink, and then when I bring the drinks, they tell me what they want to eat—what a concept, I know.

I go back to this four top again. “Drinks for anyone?” Lady: “Ohh well I have a mug here already that I want to use, it’s number ___ and I’ll have (whatever beer she ordered).” I say okay. “And we’re gonna order another mug too, but we’ll do that later on.” I say okay again. These people are really trying my patience now. Her husband orders a beer and the same lady says “So can he have his beer in a guest mug since we haven’t ordered a new engraved mug yet?” I’m like, “Well, normally we just put it in a pint glass until the mug is available for use.” (They didn’t want to be charged full price). They do the whole “Well, LAST TIME they let us,” excuse and I’m like fine okay. Bartender is like wtf. I’m like idk just do it. 

Finally get their food order in. Extra extra extra sauce, extra gravy, extra this/that “because it’s soooooooo good.” (We never charge for extra sauce or gravy).

Okay it gets to the end of the meal, they ate for like an hour and a half it was the longest I ever saw people eat a burger. I go back with the folder A SECOND TIME to get this mug order. They still can’t decide what number they want. Do they want 231 or 237. I wait and wait. Finally I get an answer and fill the stupid thing out. No dessert thank god. I bring the check. One check for the 4 people. One check for the ordered mug. 

This lady pulls her iPad out of her purse and is like “we have a $5 off coupon.” I take the iPad and as I’m clicking on it I realize it’s a screen shot and not the actual email. I’m like “ma’am, if you can pull up the actual email and not a screenshot then I can redeem this for you.” I walk away. Come back. She finds the email and I redeem it. I take the $5 off the $90 bill for the 4 people. 

She put her credit card in with the other couple’s. They want it split, fine. Then she puts THREE gift cards in to pay for the mug. I go to the computer, the mug drops to about 50% of the original price after the gift cards. I ring up the rest on her credit card. I split the tables check with the discount and take those slips back too. I wish them a good night and they’re like “oh we are part of your rewards program can you go put our names in and tell us what our points are?” So now I have to open up two separate tables to check the points on their names and take that back to them too. Again have a great night. The same lady comes up to me after the rest got up and is like “Excuse me? Was there a balance on any of those gift cards?” I’m like no ma’am that’s why I ran your credit card for both the original bill and the remaining balance on the mug order. “Oh okay, I just wanted to make sure.”

It doesn't take long but we have about 2 orders in front of you and they all ordered sandwiches.

I check with the kitchen and they tell me they are just waiting on his toast. I go back and inform him and he yelled ""I DIDN'T WANT TOAST!!""

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hello.

I'm a cashier at a small volunteer run Cafe and Bookstore. I post here often because working as a volunteer most customers think because I'm not paid they can treat me however they want.

Here's my recent work story.

So at the store we have a chalkboard behind the counter that we write the soups of the day and our seasonal drinks. We clearly label the sections so there is no mix ups or since many of the customers are elderly that it can clearly be read.

The other day a woman comes in and starts looking at the menu. I greet her warmly and ask her if she has any questions.

She pointed at the soups written on the board and asked ""Are those sandwiches?""

I am kinda shocked by this because it is clearly written above them in big white letters: ""SOUPS"" but I give her the benefit of the doubt and answer nicely ""Yep those are our soups today.""

She glared at me and said ""How am I supposed to know that?""

Again it's clearly labeled above them as SOUPS, plus Carrot Ginger would not be a good sandwich. But I keep on my great customer service voice and tell her ""We always have our soups written at the top of the board. They might change the soups but it's always written there.""

She glared at me and says ""How do I know you aren't lying to me? I don't want to order it and get some weird drink.""

,TalesFromYourServer,"Mobile formatting, sorry. 

This happened last night. It’s Saturday night with 350+ covers at a steakhouse. My section gets spread from three tables plus a private party to an additional three tables on the complete other side of our 10,000 square foot restaurant. 
I’m a team player. I don’t say no to money. The servers in that section can’t handle those three tables? You got it. I’m there. Well at 930, a four top sits down. One of them is asleep at the table, the other three are obnoxious and condescending. As I walk them through the menu, seat 2 decides to mock me and treat me like I’m stupid. She came in hammered, and definitely shouldn’t have anything else to drink. The bar shouldn’t have given her any to begin with. I get their order and bring them two extra loaves of bread to soak up the alcohol and try to take care of the rest of my tables. Well, three more of their friends show up so I have to move them
to a 7 top and rearrange position numbers with the kitchen. Their oysters come out and they’re screaming “suck it! Put it in your mouth! Suck that shit!” And other tables are staring. I tell my manager but she’s overwhelmed and says she can’t deal with it right now. Seat 4 goes to the bathroom, throws up, comes back and falls asleep again. Their food finally shows up and seat 2 slams her empty drink on the table and starts yelling at me to bring her drink she asked for. I apologize saying I didn’t remember her asking me, but to tell me what the drink is and I’ll bring another. She says “don’t play stupid, you know exactly what I’m drinking.” I respond, “I’m sorry. I don’t. But tell me what it is and I’ll get you another right away.” She starts yelling “this place is too damn expensive for you to not know what the fuck I’m drinking. Don’t play stupid. Go ask the bartender to bring me my drink!” I respond, “ok. What was the name on your tab so I can make sure we bring the right drink?” And she says “you stupid bitch fuck you. Go fuck your self! Go get my fucking drink you fucking stupid bitch.” At that point my team mate heard her yelling and came over and told her to leave. She tells him to go fuck himself too. He tells her she can’t talk to us like that and to leave. She throws her drink across the room and leaves, only to call the police (????) and call and complain three separate times. 

To top it off, the rest of the table said I caused it because I didn’t bring her a drink and provided poor service. I drop their checks and don’t go back to the table except to render payment. My managers had my back and the police laughed it off.
I can’t wait to not be a server anymore.

TLDR; a drunk lady told me I was a stupid bitch for not being psychic.

She came in hammered, and definitely shouldn’t have anything else to drink. The bar shouldn’t have given her any to begin with. I get their order and bring them two extra loaves of bread to soak up the alcohol and try to take care of the rest of my tables. Well, three more of their friends show up so I have to move them
to a 7 top and rearrange position numbers with the kitchen. Their oysters come out and they’re screaming “suck it! Put it in your mouth! Suck that shit!” And other tables are staring. I tell my manager but she’s overwhelmed and says she can’t deal with it right now. Seat 4 goes to the bathroom, throws up, comes back and falls asleep again. Their food finally shows up and seat 2 slams her empty drink on the table and starts yelling at me to bring her drink she asked for. I apologize saying I didn’t remember her asking me, but to tell me what the drink is and I’ll bring another. She says “don’t play stupid, you know exactly what I’m drinking.” I respond, “I’m sorry. I don’t. But tell me what it is and I’ll get you another right away.” She starts yelling “this place is too damn expensive for you to not know what the fuck I’m drinking. Don’t play stupid. Go ask the bartender to bring me my drink!” I respond, “ok. What was the name on your tab so I can make sure we bring the right drink?” And she says “you stupid bitch fuck you. Go fuck your self! Go get my fucking drink you fucking stupid bitch.” At that point my team mate heard her yelling and came over and told her to leave. She tells him to go fuck himself too. He tells her she can’t talk to us like that and to leave. She throws her drink across the room and leaves, only to call the police (????) and call and complain three separate times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it off, the rest of the table said I caused it because I didn’t bring her a drink and provided poor service. I drop their checks and don’t go back to the table except to render payment. My managers had my back and the police laughed it off.
I can’t wait to not be a server anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; a drunk lady told me I was a stupid bitch for not being psychic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT : I didn’t expect this to get so much attention. I just wanted somewhere to rant! Thank you guys for the kind and encouraging words!! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work at a chain pizza place as a delivery driver, but since these incidents happened in store, this story fits here better instead of r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy. We have been incredibly busy lately, which means longer make times and more flared tempers. I work in a delivery/carryout store, so there is no dine-in area. This past Friday night was brutal for multiple reasons, and we had to make two massive orders on top of all the usual Friday night chaos (one of these was free).

My store is the busiest for our chain in my city, and we have one of the highest percentages of shitheel customers that come with it. In the middle of the rush, a guy came in to pick up his food, and he, like everyone else, had to wait for it because both ovens were running and full to the brim with food and the lobby was full of people. He paid for his food, then noticed the girl making the food wasn't wearing gloves and went absolutely BALLISTIC. (We are not required to wear gloves if we wash our hands every time we change stations, which we do.) He demanded a refund and starting berating the girl with everything he could think of, insulting her looks, her family, and a lot more. Now, this girl has done time several times for drug charges, and is not one to back off when you piss her off. Fortunately for everyone involved, she is aware of this, and after a shouting match where they both told each other to fuck off, walked out the front door to cool off, wordlessly inviting him to continue the fight outside if he so desired. The guy still wasn't happy, but he took his refund and the food, so I guess he wasn't too upset about the food 'being contaminated' as he put it. 

About an hour later, a woman ordered a delivery online, then decided she wanted to pay with a credit card, so she called to do it. The credit card declined and she immediately accused the woman taking her info of stealing her money. I was the driver up on the rotation to take her delivery, and no one informed me of any of this until afterwards, so I went out to her house assuming it was a cash order. When no one answered the door or the phone, I waited out the five minutes I'm required to wait before coming back. When I arrived, the woman whose food I had was screaming in the face of the cashier about stealing her money, while her son filmed the entire confrontation. She also said the cops were on the way so if they just refunded her now everything would be swell. As she hadn't been charged, we could not refund her, and she didn't like that. When the cops arrived, she and the manager went outside to deal with the cops, and while she didn't get arrested, she didn't get her refund, either. Unlike the first guy, she also didn't get her food. 

Towards the end of the night, we were all just wanting to go home, and since we had a mountain of dishes and we had to prep dough for the next night, nobody bothered making more dough for the same night once we started selling out of stuff. At around 10:30 a woman came in to place a counter order, and she made quite clear she wanted it on regular hand-tossed dough, which we were out of. We sell thin dough, hand tossed dough, and deep dish pan dough. Pan dough costs $1 more than the other two. I was working the counter and informed the customer we were out of the hand-tossed but still had pan and thin. She didn't want the thin and got incredibly upset about the one dollar upcharge for the pan. She said her mother was in the parking lot and it was her birthday and she wanted hand-tossed blah blah blah. The manager ultimately compromised by saying to ring it up as a hand-tossed but they'd give her a pan, which the woman accepted. Then she decided her mother wanted extra cheese, which costs two dollars extra, which she was more than happy to pay for.

I work as a waitress/server/barkeeper/whatever via a company where you can rent staff for single shifts (or longer periods of time but you could always get different people).

What had happened: Two top table, both ordered our pork goulash. Both loved it and ate everything. Both of them complained AFTER finishing their meals that ""this was not purely pork I know for sure that there was beef too""

Of course thats almost impossible and non of the other guests said something similar and even the cooks double checked everything but no

,TalesFromYourServer,"(This is something I observed years ago, I don't work at a restaurant myself but this story belongs here)

I was at a chinese buffet minding my own business when the man behind me just starts yelling at his waitress. And I mean, absolutely tearing in to her. He was throwing shit around the table, slamming his hands down making the whole booth shake. I can't remember what kinds of things he was saying but he was upset that he was charged an extra $7 for the crab legs on the buffet. (Not only does it very clearly say on the sign outside that the crab legs are an additional $7, but there's a sign directly above the crab legs themselves in big red letters stating it. And our waitress told us when we sat down that they were extra, so I can only assume his did too. Even more, in the menu next to the buffet price, it said, AGAIN in big red letters, that the crab legs weren't included in the buffet price despite being on the buffet).

So the guy had no excuse not to know and was yelling at this woman who barely spoke english. She knew enough to be able to do her job but not enough to talk this man down from the ledge. All the other servers came over to help calm him down but he just couldn't be contained. Everyone in the dining area was just staring at him while he threw his tantrum. The manager finally came over (who barely spoke better english than his staff) and the man just kept saying he was going to call the city and have the place shut down. That its ""false advertisement"" and he wants his entire meal for free. (I could almost, maybe, in some distant world see it being justified to have the extra $7 taken off for him and his wife if he truly did somehow miss every single sign saying they weren't included, but not his ENTIRE meal for free. That's absurd).

So it's clear to me, everyone in the dining room, and the staff that this guy is just trying his hardest to get a free meal. I had just finished eating and when I left, he was still arguing with the manager who did at one point show him every single instance where it was posted that the crab legs weren't included in the price.

I wanted to step in so bad but was afraid to because based on his actions and the way his wife looked, I guessed he was an abusive husband. She looked terrified, just keeping her head down and not saying a word. I wish there was something more I could've done but I wasn't trying to get my ass beat. If there's any justice in the world, the restaurant didn't cave in and made him pay for his whole meal. I left before it was resolved.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Had a terrible week. From customers complaining about food &amp; prices and acting as if I made the decisions and purposely wanted to scam them and rip them off to the shop being broken into last night.

Like customers can be so toxic sometimes in how they treat you. I had anxiety after the customer complaint call I received because obviously, I had done nothing wrong - it was Deliveroo order and I'm not in the kitchen so i don't make it - but she spoke as if I did and made me feel like that... it felt like when my ex used get angry at me when I did nothing wrong.

We were broken into last night and the place was trashed. Thankfully nothing of great importance was taking. They took some stock (&amp;tried to sell it at local pubs lol) and completely trashed the place which took HOURS to clean today. As a result we opened 5 hours later than normal and had a limited menu because half our stock was thrown out as it had been left to defrost overnight or scattered all over the floors. Yet people STILL got annoyed at me that we weren't open for our usual hours and that we didn't have our full menu. ""I'm sorry you got broken into... but I'm really disappointed I came ALL THIS WAY... can you not just make me something quick even though you're closed?"". 

And then because I have the classic resting bitch face and I don't act overly sickly sweet to customers, this one guy decided I was angry (?) and communicated with my boss saying I was being rude and angry... the audio and visual recording we have of the transaction prove otherwise... 

But with all this going on, I'm so stressed out and anxious. I feel like it's hurting my soul. How do you guys remain detached or just brush it off when people are treating you like shit and being emotionally abusive?

,TalesFromYourServer,"I am the GM of a small bar/restaurant tucked away in upper middle class neighborhood. We have a ton of regulars since the neighborhood is a bunch of older folks with expendable income and young families. 

When I say this place is small, I mean it’s small (54 seats in the bar) for the volume we can crank out, especially on weekends. Well, some of my staff get an email for a party on a Friday night. Already 45 people have rsvp’d to this party in the restaurants bar without my knowledge or our owners. I’m pissed and so is my owner. How the hell do these people expect us to accommodate them on a Friday with no designated space to serve them? No notice to bring on extra staff? It’s not like we have a separate banquet room or anything.
 
Finally, someone from the party calls to speak to my never present owner after she tried contacting them so instead being the GM I take the call. I speak to the person and try and make it VERY clear 
1. We will need credit cards as soon as anything is ordered. ( we have had this issue of folks leaving with substantial tabs. )
2. We have very limited parking I ask for as many people to car pool as possible
3. Because it is FRIDAY, the BUSIEST night of the week I can only reserve one small section for them till our regular dinner service is over then they can migrate and take more tables but I cannot sacrifice the experience of other paying customers not apart of this group. I also made it clear if they had talked to us before basically forcing our hand we could have done more for them for example if they wanted this party on a Monday or Tuesday I would have gladly let them have half the bar or more. I emphasized this point nicely because only a few people in this group of 45 plan on having dinner. 90% of patrons in our bar order dinner on top of multiple drinks which means more in sales. Duh.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I bartend at a very popular chain restaurant and when I say this guy is a “regular” I mean he literally comes in everyday, has been since the restaurant opened.

Everyone in the restaurant knows him, he gets an employee discount (idk why tbh) and even sometimes gets his entire meal taken off. We will give him free beers and not charge him for what he drinks (charging a pint when he really drinks a tall) so he gets a lot of stuff for free.

Well last night (Friday) we were busier then expected. The bar was packed, we had 2 tables, and the well (where the servers get their guest drinks) was going crazy. So he could clearly see we were busy. 

There are 2 bartenders on during the weekend and honestly I didn’t even refill his beer all night or really talk to him once because I was weeded all night.

Well at a moment when I was able to get a drink he said he was ready to order, at that exact moment 2 couples sat down at the bar so I told him give me a minute and I will get his order. Well, I forgot. I didn’t get his order, he didn’t remind me, and he didn’t tell the other bartender who was the one giving him a new beer all night.

So at the end of the night my manager asks him if he ate and how everything was (my manager and I have had problems in the past and he knows this since he is in there everyday) And he tells her “no someone forgot to take me order” I hear him and I instantly remember I didn’t get his order, now I feel like the asshole and apologize and even offer to buy him something out of my own money since I forgot and he just says no I been her too long I have to go home and eat.

Am I the asshole here? Like I was busy and forgot, why wouldn’t you remind me or tell the other bartender?! Still super pissed he tried to get me in trouble but luckily my manager said she was on my side here.

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I apologize if this isn’t the right place, please let me know.

I’m currently working 4 days a week at a pub nearby, which pays my bills but not much else....had a really rough year last year and kind of gave myself some time to chill after leaving my office job to go back to restaurants(loving that decision so far) but now I need to save.

Anyway, I’ve never had 2 jobs before but full time just isn’t available at my restaurant(or most I’m assuming). I posted here because a specific worry is that my schedule changes so much and I only get it 3 days in advance, how do you coordinate these things and different managers and schedules?

Also would you recommend working 2 serving jobs? I’m not sure if I can handle working a full time job + serving but, well a full time job at min wage doesn’t pay as much as serving lol.

I’m also kind of worried about telling my manager I’m thinking of this and asking how it would work? I don’t know if I should get another job and see how their schedule would work first? And my manager loves my open availability so I’m worried she’ll be mad.

Sorry this is all over the place, I know this is something I should do, just really lost on how to manage it.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve never had 2 jobs before but full time just isn’t available at my restaurant(or most I’m assuming). I posted here because a specific worry is that my schedule changes so much and I only get it 3 days in advance, how do you coordinate these things and different managers and schedules?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also would you recommend working 2 serving jobs? I’m not sure if I can handle working a full time job + serving but, well a full time job at min wage doesn’t pay as much as serving lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also kind of worried about telling my manager I’m thinking of this and asking how it would work? I don’t know if I should get another job and see how their schedule would work first? And my manager loves my open availability so I’m worried she’ll be mad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is all over the place, I know this is something I should do, just really lost on how to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: thanks for all the advice! A new restaurant just opened down the street from the pub and I just saw a listing on indeed so I think I’m gonna try to work days there! Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Resident friendly bartender here (is that an oxymoron? No?) looking for advice. My other post didn’t really get much traction on /r/bartenders. 

Got a new gig at a chain restaurant with many many draft beer options and a cocktail program that revolves around volume and, from what I can gather, sugary martinis. 

I’m mostly interested in this job because we are going to be BUSY and I’ll be making bank. Also, the opening and closing seem super straight forward (to the point where I don’t even cut fruit or fill my own wells with ice). 

That being said, I’m having a bit of an identity crisis. I’ve always worked in restaurants that emphasize their craft cocktail programs. Low volume, lots of house infusions and syrups, emphasis on the classics. Y’all, when they told me to shake the martini until there was a layer of ice on top of the drink, my jaw nearly dropped. 

I feel like a sell out and like I’m taking a step back in concept, but it might be healthy for me to have a job like this. Somewhere where I can leave work at work and not bring it home with me, clock in and do what they want me to and rake in the cash. 

I also think it’s weird that the managers can’t hang out with staff outside of work because a lot of my close friends and mentors ARE my former managers. They inspire and encourage creativity behind the bar. They have industry ties and help me network. New bar manager seems like he was arbitrarily thrown into the position and doesn’t actually care about making drinks or bartending, and just stresses all of the rules we need to be following at all times.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I bartend at a local bar.  Usually my customers are fine and the worst I'll get is someone hitting on me.  Tonight, there was a woman at the bar who had been some trouble in the past.

Now I know this woman carries her ID on her as she's been a regular enough for me to know that, but the man she's with is a newbie.  So, I ask for his ID.

Woman (W): Oh my God!  You are so anal about that.  You are going to drive away customers if you keep asking for IDs like that.

Me: I'm sorry, I know it's annoying but I can get in trouble if I don't ask.

W: That's fucking ridiculous.  You're going to lose customers if you keep being a bitch about it.

Me: *shrugs* I don't make the laws, but I don't have $500 to pay the fine.  Besides, most people don't mind and like that their bartender is responsible.

W: I don't believe you.

M: if you really have a problem, (owner) is going to be here in about an hour and you can talk to him.

W: You know, I'm just waiting until they let you go and get a better bartender.

At this point, I give her and the guy their drinks and walk to the other side of the bar.  

An hour later, the owner arrives with his daughter and I let him know the situation and tell him that I'm going to cut her off if she continues to make a scene.

W: You know, I love you.  I don't hold grudges, but you know, you should really smile more.  You'll get more tips.

(She doesn't ever tip me, though)

Me: Ma'am, if you continue to tell me how to do my job or continue to make rude comments, you will not be served any more drinks tonight.

The woman scoffs, gives me the middle fingers and tells me to fuck off.  She then turns to the owner (sitting next to her) and says, ""Your bartender just cut me off"", as she expects him to allow her to continue drinking.

The owner shrugs and says, ""That's the bartender's decision, not mine"".

I wave good bye as she storms off.  Ironically, I couldn't stop smiling as she left.

The owner and the owners daughter told me that I handled the situation well and that the woman used to be barred but was unbarred a few years back before I started working here.  At the end of the day, I just love that the owner has my back and I don't have to deal with shitty customers like that.

,TalesFromYourServer,"You all know that scene in the Lion King with the stampede?

Yeah, most likely I will be Simba in that scene tomorrow.

I work for a small family owned business as a server. All week, the only other server has called in sick. Thankfully it has been a slow week, so I could easily handle it by myself with some help from the cashier, who basically doubles as a busser/one-use server. Saturdays, however, are far and away the busiest day of the week. Even slow days can wind up being almost $1,000. The restaurant has a kitchen the size of a walk in closet, with the dish area and prep corner making up pretty much the entire space of my room.

My father the owner is trying his best to get extra help, and as of right now it is confirmed that I will have at least 2 bussers in addition to the cashier. When we get busy, though, the cashier will most likely be swamped with togo orders and cashing people out, and the bussers will be turning tables.

If I do wind up serving solo, I have 7 tables of 4, a table of 2, and a bar that seats 17. There are spare tables in a commons area right next to ours as well (the business is part of a public shopping area), so big parties, though it isn't really allowed, will also be pulling tables together to accommodate. I'm not worried about getting swamped with customers, I'm worried about how certain ones will react. Most people who come in are regulars who are friends of my father, so they know me and know that I strive to take care of them. A lot, though, are new people, and I'm sure almost everyone on this subreddit knows what kinds of customers can appear at the busiest time of the day.

Tomorrow could be slow like the rest of the week. It could be close to our busiest Saturday ever. Either way, here's to whatever comes! Wish me luck!

Will edit the post after the day is finished to give an update.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I’ve always been somewhat of a believer that people are going to tip the way they tip no matter what, unless the service is exceptionally bad. By this I mean that if you give the best service possible and still receive 10%, those people never planned on tipping more than that in the first place.

I do still believe that for the most part, but tonight was a little different. My restaurant closes at 10, I was the only server and we died especially hard around 7:30-8. If it stays that dead, closing server will get cut early and it will just be the bartender working. Bartender let me know before 8 that I’d probably be getting cut within the hour, but it was still too early to tell. 

Bartender takes 2 more tables, I’m “unofficially” cut at this point wrapping up my last table, when a party of 7 walks in just before 8:30. I don’t really want to take it but I do, since bartender is a little busy. I was already in “about to go home” mode so I was really not feeling it, but I took 2 minutes to sigh heavily in the closet while the party took their seats. Once I’m done putting myself in the right mind-frame. I go out and deliver the best service possible.

The table was lightweight problematic, not too bad but still annoying for someone who was ready to go home. Some food was sent back, some sass was sent my way, but I still made sure to deliver the best possible service, because if I was going to get a bad tip, I sure wasn’t going to blame it on my service.

One guest asks for the check as they’re all finishing up their meals. It’s about 9:15 at this time. I cash them out, then shortly after, notice a single $5 on the table as a tip (10% tip, bleh, but whatever.) Normally at this point, I’d leave them alone until they left. But something in me told me to keep it going.

I kept their drinks refilled, made sure the table was nice and prebussed, continued engaging in conversation with them, even offered to take a picture of them all together. I knew I was getting a 10% tip, I didn’t expect any more. But I had nothing else to do while I waited for them to leave. They finally do leave about 20 minutes before closing time, and when I go back to finish cleaning up their table, 5 extra singles were laying on top of the initial $5 bill, and I know for a fact it wasn’t there before.

I know this sub is mostly about calling out annoying guests/bad experiences, and this by far wasn’t one of my favorite tables ever, but I guess I learned that in some situations, going the extra mile to make your guests feel welcome really can make a difference, even if they weren’t the easiest table to deal with. And even if I hadn’t gotten the extra money, I think I’d still be proud of myself for delivering the best service possible in a situation where I really wasn’t feeling up to it.

,TalesFromYourServer,"I used to work multiple jobs at a hotel. On one particular night, I was covering room service. The majority of our guests who call room service are very polite and tip very well.  On this particular night, I had a guest (RG= Rude Guest) call in to order shrimp. Our restaurant has many food items that contain shrimp so I asked him to be more specific. He replies that he just wants fried shrimp. We don't sell that by itself. 

Me: Sir, I understand you want fried shrimp. Did you want the fried shrimp seafood platter? Or did you want the pasta with shrimp- 

RG: NO, I TOLD YOU WHAT I WANT. I SAID I JUST WANTED FRIED SHRIMP I'VE BEEN STAYING HERE FOR 7 MONTHS I CAN ORDER WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT

Me: Sir-

RG: CAN I SPEAK TO SOMEBODY ELSE? 

I pass him off to a server, who puts in a custom order and makes up a price for him. Since she took the order, I let her take it up to him and get the tip.

The next day, I'm working in the gift shop. An older gentleman steps in to buy ice cream and a Coke. He's friendly and asks how I'm doing. Just as he's about to pay, a police officer steps in and asks if he's RG. The same RG that demanded fried shrimp. He says yes and follows the police officer out of the gift shop.

On one particular night, I was covering room service. The majority of our guests who call room service are very polite and tip very well.  On this particular night, I had a guest (RG= Rude Guest) call in to order shrimp. Our restaurant has many food items that contain shrimp so I asked him to be more specific. He replies that he just wants fried shrimp. We don&amp;#39;t sell that by itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Sir, I understand you want fried shrimp. Did you want the fried shrimp seafood platter? Or did you want the pasta with shrimp- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RG: NO, I TOLD YOU WHAT I WANT. I SAID I JUST WANTED FRIED SHRIMP I&amp;#39;VE BEEN STAYING HERE FOR 7 MONTHS I CAN ORDER WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RG: CAN I SPEAK TO SOMEBODY ELSE? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pass him off to a server, who puts in a custom order and makes up a price for him. Since she took the order, I let her take it up to him and get the tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I&amp;#39;m working in the gift shop. An older gentleman steps in to buy ice cream and a Coke. He&amp;#39;s friendly and asks how I&amp;#39;m doing. Just as he&amp;#39;s about to pay, a police officer steps in and asks if he&amp;#39;s RG. The same RG that demanded fried shrimp. He says yes and follows the police officer out of the gift shop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a a few minutes, I stepped out and RG and the police officer were nowhere to be found.

I have pretty good management and most of my coworkers actually know what teamwork is. I happen to enjoy when people from our other restaurants come in for some odd reason. 

Me: duh

DB: dumb (entitled) broad, she had a friend with her who look pretty mortified through this, but didn't really play a part.

So, these two women are sat in my section for a late lunch. They both order (maybe a $40 tab, no alcohol, just food). Halfway through their meal DB informs me that she is an employee of another one of our restaurants (we'll call it C).

DB: I want to use my employee discount. I work at 'C'. 

Me: No problem. I'll talk to my manager.

So, off I go. Now we've had people try to rip us off for this discount before (25% off everything but alcohol). Manager tells me I have to see her name and restaurant name in our scheduling ap. 

Me: Can you open your (ap) for me so I can verify your discount please?

DB: (dumb look).... Oh.... I just started... I haven't set it up yet.... 

Me: My manager won't let me discount your food unless I can verify through the ap.

DB (pulls out an employee pay card... they don't have your name on them just ""X Employee"" where the name would normally be on a credit card. As she does, I can see a man's drivers license in the wallet, and she is certainly NOT a man)

Me: I'm sorry, but my manager said I have to verify through the ap. 

DB: I'm trying but I can't get it to work. I just started there and I don't know how to set it up.

Me: You have to log in with your employee number. Its a long number that normally starts with 3 letters.

DB fiddles with it through the rest of her meal. Tries to show me an email from 'C'... this is the email I got when I was hired, it doesn't have an employee number on it.

Me: I'm sorry Ma'am, but unless you can show me through the app, then my manager won't approve the discount. 

Mind you I've told her several times now that I have no control over the discount. I've told her what the manager is requesting as proof (which is standard for ANY of the X restaurants in order to get the discount as the app shows the employees name, their brand and store number, along with their next scheduled shift, etc.)

DB: I need to speak with your manager....

Manager went out and told her EXACTLY what I had been telling her. After he finished, I returned to the table. She was just as nice as she could be, though she ran me like a step-child through most of their meal. Eventually, they finish and I take them their checks. DB decides to write a really pretty ""COME SEE ME AT C"" with a smiley face..... and $0 tip. Really?!

,TalesFromYourServer,"Bad at titles, sorry. Also, obligatory on mobile blah blah blah. 

Okay, so a couple weeks ago I had a two top come in. They were two young ladies, and all starts off well. Before I have a chance to greet the table, the hostess who sat them came up to me to let me know one of the girls was celebrating her 19th birthday. I tuck that into the back of my head, thank her, and continue doing my job. They’re a pretty nice table, easy to take care of.  However, my manager ends up coming to me twice during the meal to ask me to check on them, because the hostess keeps standing there chatting with them instead of rolling silverware, which we were desperately low on. I ended up “chasing her off” a couple of extra times too. 

I do the whole birthday thing and run their cards, and drop off the slips. The bill was split, one was 14 something and the other was 16 something. I go to another table to check on them, and the hostess is there chatting with her friends again. Then I hear one of the girls say, “Tip? Big fat ZERO.” And they all laugh. 

I’m flabbergasted. How is someone who works in the service industry even remotely okay with her fiends stiffing a server, let alone laugh when they do? I was hoping that what I heard was a joke, but nope. I pick up the slips and both girls indeed wrote a big zero on the tip line, writing it darker than the total. 

I approached the hostess after her friends had left and let her know that they had stiffed me. Conversation as follows (paraphrased, as this was a couple of weeks ago):

Me: Hey, were your friends okay with their service? 

H: Yeah, why?

Me: I mean, they didn’t leave a tip...

H: So?

Me: Well, if the service was fine, then why didn’t they tip?

H: Well, one of the girls only had $18 in her bank account. 

Me: What? Then why did they come out to eat?

H: They were hungry. 

Me: Okay, then if they couldn’t tip then they should’ve gone to Walmart for snacks, or gone to McDonalds or something. I just lost money because of them. 

H: Lost money? What do you mean?

I then had to explain that, at our restaurant, servers tip-out the hosts and bartender 3% of sales (bartenders get 3% of sales on alcohol, hosts get 3% of everything).  So, regardless of what I am tipped, I pay the hosts 3% of whatever the table decides to spend. If I get a 10% tip on sales, I’m only taking home 7% of that tip. If I get no tip, then I’m paying the hostesses out of my own pocket. 

Hopefully she understands now that what her friends did was rude, but I did hear that those girls come in all the time and never tip. I was just unlucky enough to get the table. 

I also died a little inside when her response was “They were hungry.”  Like, you want to be a server. You’ve said as much. Would you be okay with that behavior?

,TalesFromYourServer,"So I'm a server at a restaurant and they dont take checks. It's on our front door and on the menu. 

Last week I had a table come in, a couple and their teenage son. Everything goes good, they're nice and polite. Until it's time to pay the bill. 

I saw the wife pull out her checkbook and get ready to write a check. So I popped over and reminded them that we dont take checks. 

Shes immediately mad. Claiming she paid with a check here a few weeks ago, which I'm sure means they wrote the check and took off before her server noticed it. 

I explain that its company policy. She (loudly) goes ""well how am I supposed to pay for this then??"" I can see inside her wallet at that point and I can see at least three different credit/debit cards. I politely explain that we take cash or card only. She ends up pulling out a card. After I run it and drop off the receipts I can hear her complaining to her husband how she wasnt going to tip me because I wouldn't let her write a check. Sure enough, not a penny for a tip. 

It's not my policy lady! It's the owners. And if you dont have money in your account to use a card you have no business writing a check here either!

It&amp;#39;s on our front door and on the menu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I had a table come in, a couple and their teenage son. Everything goes good, they&amp;#39;re nice and polite. Until it&amp;#39;s time to pay the bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the wife pull out her checkbook and get ready to write a check. So I popped over and reminded them that we dont take checks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shes immediately mad. Claiming she paid with a check here a few weeks ago, which I&amp;#39;m sure means they wrote the check and took off before her server noticed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain that its company policy. She (loudly) goes &amp;quot;well how am I supposed to pay for this then??&amp;quot; I can see inside her wallet at that point and I can see at least three different credit/debit cards. I politely explain that we take cash or card only. She ends up pulling out a card. After I run it and drop off the receipts I can hear her complaining to her husband how she wasnt going to tip me because I wouldn&amp;#39;t let her write a check. Sure enough, not a penny for a tip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not my policy lady! It&amp;#39;s the owners. And if you dont have money in your account to use a card you have no business writing a check here either! &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Several years ago I ran a small, but loved, blues club outside of Chicago. 

The village’s downtown area in which the business was located had a yearly Street Fest. Basically they would block off the entire downtown area, have a stage and beer truck and vendors set up. 

I had a love hate. Loved the foot traffic (we were right in the middle of the highest traffic area). Hated the drunk idiots/kids that didn’t understand that laws still existed during Street Fest. A constant barrage of “I forgot my ID,” to “can I leave with this cocktail? They are only selling beer?” (The village made it clear that fines would be given to any bar that was allowing to go drinks. The beer trucks raise money for the cops, so, can’t mess with that apparently.)

Toward the end of the night, I notice a group of suspicious acting youths come in. Two of them head to my bar, two to a table, about at least four dart straight to the bathroom. 

Blonde: “We need eight bud lights.”

Me: “I need eight IDs or eight people in front of me at least.”

Blonde: “That’s not fair. I’m ordering these drinks (Illinois technically has a one drink law, though no bar follows it.), you have to give them to me.”

Me: “No. I don’t.” 

So she storms off back to the table. I quickly grab my server and tell her to ignore them. I’m fact I tell my entire staff they can only order through me. 

They flag down a waitress, she politely tells them it isn’t their table but they can get help. 

Enter me again. 

Me: “hey guys, IDs please.”

Blonde: “we are waiting for a server.”

Me: “Hi. I’m your server.”

Blonde: “You’re just the bartender”

Me: “Actually General Manager, but during Street Fest I’m a dishwasher if needed. It’s busy if you didn’t notice.”

The group starts getting rowdy. Complaining that they want beers. Not a single one has been able to produce a form of identification. They looked maybe of age but during Street Fest we card everyone. The cops send in sting ops and shit. 

So finally I give up and tell them it’s time to go. They start begging and pleading with me. Then it turns to anger and threats. Finally the shining star of the group, Dude Bro, decides to speak.

But the details! The details of everything!!! Oh no, not for me.

I was working for a well known restaurant in my city, the owner has 2 other in her name, the kind of place where a table of 2 will eat my rent worth of food in one night.

Holiday season, office parties everywhere and every weekend available. This groupe had 30 people and I was in charge of helping the waiter with the table. We were just 2 and that's alright, the menu was predetermined anyway.

But we have to change the cutlery in between services, what I think it's a waste of time and totally unnecessary, but looks like our customer can't eat their main plate with the same fork from the appetizers.

,TalesFromYourServer,"This happened during our city's restaurant week.  Obligatory not (any longer) a server.  
Walked into a restaurant that was doing the restaurant week special.  Three of us had been before and loved it, one was new.  For those who don't know, during restaurant weeks places will have an optional set menu (3 courses, usually, here) for a set price.  It's a chance for them to showcase specialties and attract new customers.  This particular establishment seats about 60 -  has a cool, semi-industrial vibe and American comfort food / Indian fusion cuisine that's to die for.  So it tends to be popular, especially with the after work crowd.  When we arrived, there were about 20 people over 8 tables.  Unfortunately, that's when we discovered the hostess was also the bartender and the -only- server.  The other no-called / no-showed.  And this was right at that weird sweet spot just before the happy hour crowd comes in, so it was getting busy.

Our waitress was a frigging rockstar.  She was sweet, explained everything, and was completely unruffled.  Sure, we had to wait a bit to get drinks and what not - but it really didn't matter.  To say she was busting her ass was an understatement - hell, she was even bussing if she walked past a table that needed clearing and she had empty hands.  JUUUUST as the place started to fill up, two other servers made it in and the FoH manager was handling everything and anything that needed done to pick up the slack.

One of our group tends to be hard to please.  She's not a Mildred (Karen with an AARP card), but she's particular about food and service (having done both).  She walked out singing our server's praises and planning for the next trip back.

So, to all of you who are out there on the front lines, thank you.  We see you.  We appreciate the hell out of everything you do.  THANK YOU.

Little back story, my job doesn't ""allow"" colored hair. Except almost everyone that worked there when I started had colored hair. I'm the only one left that's got extremely noticable hair. (It's an ombre color, black and then purple.) 

The other day I was told to make it darker, it was getting very light cause you know.. showers.. he did not specify a color! So me being the smart ass I am, I just made it a darker purple. 

I come in the next day and he tells me it needs to be black or brown. It's a very dark purple. 

Cue eye roll lol. 

Anyway, I have a table and we're all sitting there talking and they compliment my nail color (it's a gorgeous purple!) And I was like oh yeah it matches my hair! (I'm told to keep my hair in a bun and I can have my hair the way it is) 

I made a joke about how my boss says I need to change the color and yadayada.

I was like ""Oh probably not, I like this job!""

The one gentleman, probably early 50's, at the table goes ""Well tell your boss to come over here!""

,TalesFromYourServer,"First time poster and on mobile, apologize for format. Now then, onto the story.

So this happened today actually, I work at an applebees and as you know, we have late night half apps that usually draw in herds of high schoolers and college students. Today was a slow day and I had just gotten a table of 2, soon to be 4. While waiting for the rest of their party, 2 more people walk in and wait 0.5 seconds before seating themselves in the closed area of my section. I walk over, kindly ask them to move to the open area, which they agree and this dude is so high, he's somewhere around Jupiter right now. So when I seat them I ask for their drinks as per normal, girl asks for hot chocolate, guy asks for watermelon margarita, which we dont have and rather than look at the listed flavors on the drink menu, just asks what we have, which is understandable, I'm used to it, but my mind is still not at full capacity after recovering from a cold. I get their drinks, the rest of the party of 4 shows up at my first table and I get them their waters with lemon (which will always annoy me, still have no idea why). 

Here's the kicker, I bring high table their drinks and ask what they'd want, as it turns out, they didnt want half apps, they wanted to read from the regular menu which they never got because they sat themselves and never brought it to my attention. I grab those and silverware to save me another request later and let them do their thing. I turn around to party table, nobody knows what they want, understandable, I'll give them a few minutes. I come back, check on party table first since I believe theyll be quick, still no decision, I'll  check back later. High table wants a 2 for 20, no surprise there but they think that the sides are locked in to mashed potatoes and broccoli as shown on the picture, no, that's just an example. I explain that they can choose any two sides and direct them to the page, guy only orders one and closes the menu, so I ask him if he would like a second one and exclaims in surprise that he didnt know you got two. Girl was completely clueless as to where the sides were even though I flipped to them right in front of her face. They finally get everything in after some much needed explanation as to how a menu works, I write it down and turn to party table. 

The same guy has been staring at the half apps menu since my second check back and didnt even pass it on to anyone else, so the rest were still clueless, I'll come back in another few minutes. This is my fourth time checking back and as it turns out, the guy hogging the menu cant have any of it, so it was basically a major waste of time there and the girl he showed up with didnt want anything either, so alright then. The other two finally order something, but the first guy decides to point to the menu, hold it up and say.

""This thing here at the bottom""

Dude, it has a name... in BOLD that everyone knows and isnt complicated at all. Classic combo sampler. At least the girl made it easy with mozzarella sticks. By the time I got to my POS system, I just hit my head against it and stayed there for a solid 30 seconds wondering what in the world just happened. The rest of the night wasnt as bad, I ran out the food, high dude for some reason didnt recognize his loaded baked potato which he showed excitement towards when ordering it and set it to the side only to ask for a box later, still unsure on what happened there. High table payed and left first, leaving about a 30% tip which I appreciated. Party table decided to pay and then stay damn near till closing, they only decided to leave when I began flipping tables over in order to clean under them. For the final touch, the moment they left, I collected the checkbooks to get my signed receipts when I see someone left their card. Now you might be thinking this is normal, but hear me out. They left their card when I had placed it in front of the receipts so you would NEED to move it in order to sign, not to mention, the card was designed with a brightly colored butterfly and a purple flower; how in the world do you miss that?!?! Luckily, I caught up to them in the parking lot, returned the card, did my closing work and finally, went home to type this right here. On a subreddit I found by complete accident.

This is my fourth time checking back and as it turns out, the guy hogging the menu cant have any of it, so it was basically a major waste of time there and the girl he showed up with didnt want anything either, so alright then. The other two finally order something, but the first guy decides to point to the menu, hold it up and say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This thing here at the bottom&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude, it has a name... in BOLD that everyone knows and isnt complicated at all. Classic combo sampler. At least the girl made it easy with mozzarella sticks. By the time I got to my POS system, I just hit my head against it and stayed there for a solid 30 seconds wondering what in the world just happened. The rest of the night wasnt as bad, I ran out the food, high dude for some reason didnt recognize his loaded baked potato which he showed excitement towards when ordering it and set it to the side only to ask for a box later, still unsure on what happened there. High table payed and left first, leaving about a 30% tip which I appreciated. Party table decided to pay and then stay damn near till closing, they only decided to leave when I began flipping tables over in order to clean under them. For the final touch, the moment they left, I collected the checkbooks to get my signed receipts when I see someone left their card. Now you might be thinking this is normal, but hear me out. They left their card when I had placed it in front of the receipts so you would NEED to move it in order to sign, not to mention, the card was designed with a brightly colored butterfly and a purple flower; how in the world do you miss that?!?! Luckily, I caught up to them in the parking lot, returned the card, did my closing work and finally, went home to type this right here. On a subreddit I found by complete accident. Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Great job, it hadn’t been bought by Darden yet, so...that long ago.

Its a Friday night, we are working a 2 hour wait, the restaurant is full. (Which means the  grill is full etc).

I walk up to the booth I just got sat, a nice enough couple on a date.  They had waited 90 minutes to be sat.

As I’m schpieling, the gentleman interrupts me to tell me “I am deathly allergic to garlic, and onion and it cannot be anywhere near my plate.”

I go confused,  offer to get a manager since this is beyond my wheelhouse.

Go down to the line tell the GM and have to pull him off Expo. He goes “Ill talk to him”

I was off to the side.

GM goes. “Sir, I was told you are deathly allergic to garlic and onion?”

Guy on date: “Yeah, I can’t have it anywhere near my food.”

GM: “Well, I need to ask you to leave then as we cannot accomadate you, those spices are in everything we have except deserts, and I cannot guarantee the deserts haven’t had some contamination with the spices in the air. I’m really sorry but I have no food that is safe for you.”

,TalesFromYourServer,"Last week someone else’s table waved me down so I went to see what they wanted. It was a couple in their 50s. The man says “what happened?” I was confused as hell and asked what he meant and he said “your face. There’s sparkles all over it”. I thought he might be joking but his wife looked appalled and said “it’s her makeup!” I laughed awkwardly and confirmed it was makeup I intentionally put on my face. He looked really surprised and confused and said “oh are you sure? I hate when I get that stuff on me I’d never do it on purpose!” I obviously didn’t take offence to it or anything but it was SO WEIRD. 

I wasn’t wearing eyeshadow or bronzer or anything so he was surely referring to my highlight which is aggressively sparkly and I do get comments on it often just not like this lmao.

It was a couple in their 50s. The man says “what happened?” I was confused as hell and asked what he meant and he said “your face. There’s sparkles all over it”. I thought he might be joking but his wife looked appalled and said “it’s her makeup!” I laughed awkwardly and confirmed it was makeup I intentionally put on my face. He looked really surprised and confused and said “oh are you sure? I hate when I get that stuff on me I’d never do it on purpose!” I obviously didn’t take offence to it or anything but it was SO WEIRD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t wearing eyeshadow or bronzer or anything so he was surely referring to my highlight which is aggressively sparkly and I do get comments on it often just not like this lmao.

,TalesFromYourServer,"Not 15 years to the day you understand, that would be far too poetic and magical, but 15 years 'roughly'. I started working in a Chinese buffet place when I was 16, running dishes and scrubbing pots. I saw two grown women fight over a double-booked table, it came to blows, one pushed the other over, fried shrimp and cheap prosecco took flight, the husbands tried to intervene, they were unsuccessful. 

And on that day I became a man.

I would jump from services to retail, to hospitality then back to services. Hired, fired, re-hired, fired again, promoted, demoted, burned, scarred and have held ""almost"" every position in a restaurant outside of General Manager, to which I am very grateful for.

After 15 years I've finally bagged a non-services job, my last shift is Friday. Everyone at the place I currently work is sad, my manager is sad, the regular customers are sad, I am pretending to be sad. But the one thing I'll never forget is the stories, the tales of Karens clawing their way up through the pits of hell, at night they fill my dreams asking if the chicken is gluten-free and demanding to speak to the manager. I don't think I'll ever run out of stories, or stop enjoying the look of horror spread over people's faces as I recite them for those who have enjoyed the luxury of never working in our sector. 

So without further creative ramble, here are the top complaints I've received from customers. Organized in a list, in no specific order because that sounded like too much work.  

&amp;#x200B;

1)  ""WHAT' A' 'E'' MEAN ''U CAN' GI'B ME BEER? GIMMIE A DRINK Y'A \*\*\*\*\* OR I'LL HAVE A WORD WI' YO'R MANAGER AND GIT Y' FIRED\*smug look\*"" 

Context: Fast food restaurant thought it was a good idea to serve beer. We were open 24/7 and stopped serving beer at 10pm, every weekend (or around any major sporting event) as the bars closed and the drunk zombies stumbled home they passed our sign, beaming like a lighthouse in an otherwise empty and dark street, a small tiny part of their brain we call ""the Nugget center"" would light up and a voice would start screaming ""Nuggets!"" in their ear. They stumble in through the front door, see the massive POS advert for our new branded beer and immediately come to the conclusion they could continue drinking here.

This was particularly bad when large groups of track suit wearing sluggers would swarm the place trying to convince me to keep serving them often with the wonderful phrase ""Show me the rule where it says I can't drink here?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

2) My Sushi is Cold!

Context: or ""My fish is Raw!!"" or ""Where is the meat? Why is it all rice??!"" or ""Why is it so small?"" kind of complaints you get from people who have no idea what sushi is and just want to try it because it's the office trend. Pretty confident anyone who's worked in a sushi place has had to deal with these idiots.

&amp;#x200B;

3) My **DISABLED** child said the food I ordered for my **DISABLED** child was cold, do you know how hard it is for me to have a **DISABLED** child and how disappointed my **DISABLED** child was when my **DISABLED** child ordered your food. Did I mention my child is **DISABLED**? 

Context: Take-out place, not exact words but roughly this was the context of their argument. Their food was cold, their child was disabled. She genuinely shouted the word disabled louder every time she said it, and she said it as every opportunity. She also had no child with her.

The best part? The receipt for her food was dated 7 months prior. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) ""Excuse me, I booked! Why am I not allowed to sit down?""

Context: the building was on fire. No I'm not making that up. A large neon sign had overheated and flames started erupting from it. The restaurant had been evacuated, four fire engines were parked outside, the alarm was still going off and the place was filled with smoke. The fire had been put out by this point and the GM had returned to the building to turn off the alarm while the Fire dept examined the sign. Enter stage left, woman in early 50's, stands by the 'please wait here to be seated sign', FF noticed her, wanders over and tells her the place is 'obviously closed'. She huffs and leaves, walks outside and pulls out her phone. She downloads the Restaurant app, makes a reservation for that day, then walks *back* into the restaurant which is still full of smoke, demands to see the manager and proclaims loudly that she has a reservation and the law requires we serve her.

She was not alone. Over the course of the next few hours, while we were still around, several more people would attempt to walk into the smokey, dark restaurant. A few laughed it off ""Oh guess I need better glasses then, ha ha"" and another demanded to know why we were closed, dragged my GM outside and tried to point to the opening times posted on the door ""See it's not 10pm yet, you *should* be open"".

&amp;#x200B;

5) ""The Ice in my water has watered down my water, I demand a free replacement""

and

6) ""What do you mean Your staff won't go to McDonalds for us? We PAID to be here!""

Context:  explained here [https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the\_night\_of\_the\_living\_vegans/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the_night_of_the_living_vegans/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 

But for tldr; I'll just say this. Vegan Influencers.

&amp;#x200B;

7) The customer demanded to free replacement on her cappuccino because ""it was too wet""

Context: I mean how do you respond to that? After biting down my tongue to resist the temptation to point out that coffee is a liquid which, historically, has always been wet. I get her to clarify, after a bit of back and forth, and with a lot of tutting, it turns out what she actually wants is a Babyccino, some weird drink made-up by upper-middle-class people to give to children who want to sit in on the ""fun"" of having coffee with Sharon from jazzercise class.

It's all foam, with some chocolate powder sprinkled over the top.

&amp;#x200B;

8)  Guy comes in, orders two cheeseburgers, two coffees, and a cake, hands me $5 and looks genuinely offended that it didn't cover the full cost. 

Context: He wasn't old enough for it to be a generational thing. But the look he gave me when I told him the price made me think he'd misheard me say something rude about his mother. He pulled out a 20, threw it on the counter then yanked his phone out of his pocket and made a show of calling his friend to complain about the over-priced restaurant he was in.

&amp;#x200B;

9) How to order a coffee in &lt;popular student cafe&gt;:

1) Wander aimlessly around the store for 10 minutes  
2) Stare at the menu for a further 10 minutes ignoring the man behind the till asking if you need assistance.  
3) Wait till the vendor starts serving someone else then glare at them.  
4) Order a coffee that wasn't on the menu, ask for it to be topped off with Yoghurt and crushed Almonds  
5) Stare in disbelief at the menu for another 10 minutes when informed the cafe cannot fulfill your request.  
6) Order a cappuccino  
7) Leave the counter and await coffee by standing in the middle of the shop with your arms folded.  
8) Wait till Vendor has prepared coffee, brought it to you and started to walk away.  
9) Ask for extra sugar, wait till vendor returns with sugar.  
10) demand a Take-out cup.  
11) Leave requested additional sugar on the table as you walk out. 

Also includes this wonderful transaction at the same location:

Them: Tea Please  
Me: how do you like it?  
Them: medium, please  
Me:...OK, sugar?  
Them: Yes  
Me: how many?  
Them: with milk, please.  
Me: alright so no sugar?  
Them: uhhh.....just medium, please. 

Speaking of which I really wish people waiting in line wouldn't jangle change and stare at me while I'm serving someone, what are they expecting me to drop everything I'm doing and run over to them and say ""Oh I'm sorry sir I wasn't aware you had MONEY how foolish of me to serve that other person first just because they came in and ordered before you, how cass of me I do apologize"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway

10) ""How can it possibly take you longer than 5 minutes to cook a full meal? \*I\* can do it at home in less time!""

Context: They had a lecture at 10am (and made sure I was well aware of that), came in around 9:40, sat down ordered coffee, then and 9:50am asked for two full breakfast meals sit-in.  
I explained that it would take at least 10 mins to cook both breakfasts and the extra coffee and they wouldn't have enough time to get to the lecture hall at 10 but they ordered regardless, paid then 5 mins later complained I was being too slow and ""now had to run"". 

They came back later and demanded a full explanation as to how it was not possible to cook a full breakfast meal in under 5 minutes, line by line with 'exact' cooking times specified.

&amp;#x200B;

11) \*In an attempt to prize open the door\* ""You're still in there, I can see you! that means you're open! Stop trying to be lazy and serve me!"" 

Or words to that effect, this was so long ago I can't honestly remember what he said, I only remember that boiled ham face with its weird cheesy grin as he attempted to destroy me with Facts and Logic. 

Now I've seen enough stories on this subreddit to know I am not alone when it comes to customers trying to force their way into empty, closed restaurants so I won't bore you with the details only that our door was on a motor, you turn the little key and the shutter comes down. 

While closing one night two hands appear under the shutter just before it hits the ground and an effort is made to push the shutter back up. Thinking this might be an emergency or something I raise the shutter only to be confronted by a man who rushes the door, glares at me and starts pounding on the glass demanding to be let in because he'd 'caught' us trying to close early.

We'd closed on time, some half-hour ago, pulling the shutter down was the last thing we did at night.

&amp;#x200B;

12) ""What do you mean you will not honor this deal made by the previous business?""

Context: The restaurant sat on property previously owned by a large chain restaurant. That restaurant had closed down nearly 12 years ago after moving to a different part of town, yet people still came waddling in with vouchers and coupons for that company expecting us, a very clearly different restaurant, to honor them. Some arguments got very heated and if I could tell you the name of that restaurant you could go look at the *hundreds* of 1-star yelp reviews complaining that we don't honor other restaurants coupon deals.   

&amp;#x200B;

and finally

&amp;#x200B;

13) ""What do you mean you're open Sunday? That is the LORDS day""

Yes, this did happen. We received a very long, yet very polite letter from a local priest questioning our decision to open Sundays and requesting we close that day in order to give the staff time to rest and pray as our Lord (in one religion) did when he created the world and threatened to preach to his pulpit to people not to come to the restaurant on Sundays. He also questioned a lot of other things that I won't mention in polite company but let's just say if you dyed your hair blue you were getting nasty looks from Agnus and the Sunday Squad.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's all I can think of for now.

Go away. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Or words to that effect, this was so long ago I can&amp;#39;t honestly remember what he said, I only remember that boiled ham face with its weird cheesy grin as he attempted to destroy me with Facts and Logic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve seen enough stories on this subreddit to know I am not alone when it comes to customers trying to force their way into empty, closed restaurants so I won&amp;#39;t bore you with the details only that our door was on a motor, you turn the little key and the shutter comes down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While closing one night two hands appear under the shutter just before it hits the ground and an effort is made to push the shutter back up. Thinking this might be an emergency or something I raise the shutter only to be confronted by a man who rushes the door, glares at me and starts pounding on the glass demanding to be let in because he&amp;#39;d &amp;#39;caught&amp;#39; us trying to close early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d closed on time, some half-hour ago, pulling the shutter down was the last thing we did at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) &amp;quot;What do you mean you will not honor this deal made by the previous business?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: The restaurant sat on property previously owned by a large chain restaurant. That restaurant had closed down nearly 12 years ago after moving to a different part of town, yet people still came waddling in with vouchers and coupons for that company expecting us, a very clearly different restaurant, to honor them. Some arguments got very heated and if I could tell you the name of that restaurant you could go look at the &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of 1-star yelp reviews complaining that we don&amp;#39;t honor other restaurants coupon deals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and finally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) &amp;quot;What do you mean you&amp;#39;re open Sunday? That is the LORDS day&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this did happen. We received a very long, yet very polite letter from a local priest questioning our decision to open Sundays and requesting we close that day in order to give the staff time to rest and pray as our Lord (in one religion) did when he created the world and threatened to preach to his pulpit to people not to come to the restaurant on Sundays. He also questioned a lot of other things that I won&amp;#39;t mention in polite company but let&amp;#39;s just say if you dyed your hair blue you were getting nasty looks from Agnus and the Sunday Squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s all I can think of for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and remember if you do go into a stylish Asian restaurant, don&amp;#39;t order the duck pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"I work 12 hour shifts at a 'high end' sandwich place which also serves fresh juices and smoothies. This tale just happened and I'm kinda still dumbfounded. 

A little back story- I fell on my leg and hurt it pretty badly last week. The pain felt unbearable on this day. I couldn't find anyone to take my shift so I just had to keep working.

This is the 9th hour of my workday and I was at the cashier when these two Ladies walk in and order with the numbers listed on the menu instead of the names. I take their order normally and went to help my coworkers. Their food is served and after a few moments they come by and say, they got the wrong drinks. They ordered smoothies, not juices. And I realised because of my preoccupation with pain I forgot to ask them if they wanted the juice or smoothie. 

Okay fair enough. I apologise and explain to them what happened and ask my coworker to make them the right order, no charge, and I go back to work. My other coworker asked me what happened and I also explain the mistake to her.

After their correct order was done the lady just all of a sudden bursted out like a chest monster- 'This is not the right way to treat customers', 'I come here everyday and this is not the right color of the drink' and 'I work in the service industry too and I would never treat my paying customers like this.'

At this point the whole restaurant is looking at this yelling lady. I limp over to see what's happening and she unleashes another word vomit cloud on me. As we keep asking what's the problem and how we can fix it she just keeps shouting at the top of her lungs 'you can't treat customers like this'. So to finish this I apologise to her again and go back to work.

She storms off and a minute later the other lady walks in and starts talking to the shift manager. Apparently when I explained to them my mistake I was talking very 'rudely'. And then I turned around and 'talked shit' about them to my coworker. And apparently my other coworker made their drinks wrong to spite them for some reason.

I'm sorry lady that you're so unhappy in life that you have to yell at service people because they didn't behave like sunshine is coming out of your ass. I'm still super confused as to what triggered this person so much. This place gets busy and we make hundreds of orders per day. Mistakes are bound to happen from both sides.

So there I was on an unassuming Sunday afternoon, mind full of hope and a naive attitude. I was only a smidge hungover from the night before but nothing was going to stop me from getting that bread today. I walked into work dick swinging in the breeze and tossed my jacket on a chair like the fucking Fonz. I decided to walk through the back of house with my sunglasses on so I could stunt of these cooks and server hoes. I relieved the morning bartender with a high five and began to get that sourdough. 

An hour or so into the shift things are going great, I’m working my tables and rocking my bar top like I’m Kanye at friends wedding. Needless to say I’m crushing it. Before I could even polish my pimp cup for my post shift buss down, in walks hell in a bad haircut. This woman looked like Peggy Bundy and Peggy Hill has a sister who was a total asshole. An Omega-level Karen. Like, if Magneto or fuckin Thanos just wanted to go in on a bartender this was the one.  I’m used to dealing wit these hoes so I go in like Drake at a high school prom. 

I wait what I call a required four minutes to go greet her and her dumb looking husband and she says, hey.....my dude....we ready. I’m like bet, this bout to be easy as hell. It wasn’t. 

*a bar ticket prints

Not only was this bitch not ready but she was so lost in the entire idea of people ordering food from a person in a place where people order food from a person. Mind you, I wasn’t super busy at the time but I would end up in so deep in the weeds I’d need a machete to find my way out. The following convo went like this:

*a bar ticket prints

Me: are we ready to order?
Custy: yes. And we are in a rush to get home to our dogs sooooooooo......
Me: no prob. What are we drinking?
C: I’d like a beer what do you have on tap?
Me 😑 standing in front of her while we are both literally 11inches away from the taps listing them all off. 

*a bar ticket prints

C: ya know what I’ll have a martini
M: what sorta vodka would you like?
C: I’d like a blackberry sangria

*a bar ticket prints

At this point two of my tables are giving me the ‘i would like my check’ wave

Me: ok the sangr-
C (while holding the drink menu in her hand) : actually what do you have for bottled beer?

*a bar ticket prints

I list off the beer list. 
The couple two seats down ask for refills 
The couple behind me ask for ketchup
The guy at the end of the bar points at his empty glass

*another fucking bar ticket prints

Me: so what are we thinking?
C: I’ll have a tall bud light
Me: ok. And for the husband?
H: a margarita

*another ticket prints how have we not run out of fucking paper yet!!!!!!!!

C: I’ll also have a margarita
Me: okely dokely you fucking terrorist

This took 6.38 minutes 

So I get their stupid drinks and food in and then I realize I have four checks to drop off and eventually cash out, what feels like 90 tickets and 137 drinks to make in the printer, 5 drinks to make on the bar top, one side of ketchup, two diet cokes I definently have to go out back for because this gun fucking sucks or whatever, this hoe over here needs ranch, dummy at 103 asks to change to some baseball game, I just got sat again and the bud light keg just kicked. Fml 

*another ticket prints

And then she sat there for two hours yelling at her husband and left mediocre tip. The end

,TalesFromYourServer,"Last night I worked a 14 top. They were all terrible people, douchiest people I have ever come in contact with. The royal family of Douchland. One guy sits down and orders a beer. He says, “Every time you come to the table I want you to have a beer for me.” I thought he was probably just joking, so I leave and come back and he says, “Where is my beer? Did you really forget what I told you like 2 minutes ago? Wow.” So I said, “OH! I am so sorry it won’t happen again.” So, for the next 2 hours, no matter what. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I approached the table I left a beer. After about
45 minutes the  beer began to pile up. A friend of King Doucherbottom tried to take one that I put down, but I grabbed it and said, “Sorry sir, this is your friends beer I would be happy to get one for you if you like.” Long story short he ended up buying 25 beers at 8 dollars a pop with a 20% mandatory auto-grat on the table. He maybe drank 4. I have never felt so good in my life. It doesn’t pay to be an arrogant ass folks!

EDIT: Man, thanks everyone! This was a crowning achievement in my 7 years of serving. I work at a place where some people come in and treat me like a piece of stew meat, and I have learned to play the game in order to make money. I love my job and the people I meet, but I get stepped on a lot. Its nice to win one and have you guys appreciate it.

EDIT AGAIN: This is incredibly humbling. I knew it was a good Server Tale, but thank you guys! I don’t post much on anything ever, so this means so much that you guys liked what I did. 

To answer some questions: They split the bill seven ways. They did not even look at the charges. I put down the bill and the cards went on top. Their total bill was about 1200 everything included, beer, food, and all. This not common at a 14 top where I work, but not surprising. I came out making around 240 before tip out. 

I work at an independent fine dining italian restaurant outside of Chicago. 

Every time I put a beer down he said nothing. If he would have acknowledged my presence and told me to stop I would have. He said nothing. I started to feel bad, for a couple minutes,  and then he yelled at me like a dog to get the food out faster.  THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED. I just want to reiterate that. HE ASKED FOR IT. Also, I was watching him drink. If at any point his behavior/ consumption increased I would have stopped. He walked out the exact same way he walked in. Like a doucher. 

The beer was SURROUNDING HIS SEATING AREA. Just bottles and bottles and bottles. It was incredible. 

I make my own drinks where I work, as we don’t have a typical bar, just a large server station. No bar tender was involved.

I cannot deny the illegality of it, but I do not regret it!

The BOH and bussers enjoyed the undisturbed beers. I felt so good bringing them back in a bus tub of ice. It was like seeing the excitement of children on Christmas morning.

,TalesFromYourServer,"A recent story in here reminded me of an asshole I had at one of my very first customer service jobs... 

I was working my first shift as a manager at a very famous sandwich shop that used to have a pedophile as their mascot. That's not an import detail, but I hated that guy from the day his mug showed up on our cups... 

My store was in a tiny little town about an hour south of Pittsburgh. The biggest event of the summer was taking place - the carnival - and it was happening right outside our back door. Our evenings were full of drunk people, annoying kids and bags of forgotten goldfish.

Yet, it was Friday morning when we got our worst customer.

What walked in our door could be described as 'human' but only in the loosest possible terms. He shambled. He didn't make eye contact. He was dirty. He was very clearly still on the drunk side of hungover... he was a traveling carney man.

I don't mean to insult carnies as a whole. My childhood best friend is a carney and one of the hardest working people I've ever met... the guy in my sandwich shop was quite clearly the genesis if the carnie stereotype.

I was standing behind the glass with a co-worker when the carnie stumbled up to the glass and said that he wanted a sub.

""What kind of sub sir?""
""I don't care.""
""Well would you like an Italian or stea...""
""I don't fucking care!!!""

We decided on a steak sub, double meat, double cheese.

""OK sir, how about veggies?""
""What?""
""What veggies would you like on your sub?""
""All of them!""

Lettuce, onions, tomato, black olives, yellow peppers, jalapeños (we carried them), green peppers, cucumbers, pickles...

""What would you like for a dressing?""
""What?!""
""Italian? Mayon...""
""Can't you fuckin hear? Put it all on there!!! Fuck!!!""

Italian, oil &amp; vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup (don't ask), salt &amp; pepper, Italian seasoning... oh and (I remembered we had seasonal item sauces in the walk-in) gyro sauce and tartar sauce from lent, the year before.

""For here or to go?""

""Here!""
""That'll be $12.73"" (or whatever a double meat/cheese 11 inch sub costs) 

It was the largest, sloppiest, nastiest sub we had ever created. By the time he got it unwrapped the bread had turned to mush and the fillings slopped out on the wrapper. He proceeded to eat it fistfull by fistfull. 

We watched in horror and awe. 

He finished it, and just as I was starting to feel guilt over being part of ruining this guy's day, he stands up, cleans up his table and thanks us for the best damn sub he has ever had.

&lt;p&gt;I was standing behind the glass with a co-worker when the carnie stumbled up to the glass and said that he wanted a sub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What kind of sub sir?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Well would you like an Italian or stea...&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t fucking care!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided on a steak sub, double meat, double cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OK sir, how about veggies?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;What veggies would you like on your sub?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;All of them!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lettuce, onions, tomato, black olives, yellow peppers, jalapeños (we carried them), green peppers, cucumbers, pickles...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What would you like for a dressing?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;What?!&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Italian? Mayon...&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t you fuckin hear? Put it all on there!!! Fuck!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian, oil &amp;amp; vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup (don&amp;#39;t ask), salt &amp;amp; pepper, Italian seasoning... oh and (I remembered we had seasonal item sauces in the walk-in) gyro sauce and tartar sauce from lent, the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For here or to go?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here!&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;ll be $12.73&amp;quot; (or whatever a double meat/cheese 11 inch sub costs) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the largest, sloppiest, nastiest sub we had ever created. By the time he got it unwrapped the bread had turned to mush and the fillings slopped out on the wrapper. He proceeded to eat it fistfull by fistfull. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched in horror and awe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He finished it, and just as I was starting to feel guilt over being part of ruining this guy&amp;#39;s day, he stands up, cleans up his table and thanks us for the best damn sub he has ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the customer is right on on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Two days ago around the beginning of the dinner rush, the hostess was trying to seat a four top in my section. They totally ignored her then went to a table that still had dirty dishes and trash all over it.

No place has gotten her order right in months. It’s not my fault, she knows logically I wasn’t back there cooking. I repeated her order back, but now I must think she’s crazy. She’s not crazy! I must know she’s not crazy! She just wants to have a nice meal out with her husband!

It’s not my fault, she knows logically I wasn’t back there cooking. I repeated her order back, but now I must think she’s crazy. She’s not crazy! I must know she’s not crazy! She just wants to have a nice meal out with her husband! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions, a customer might get to me. But I wasn’t upset or angry, just kinda dumbstruck. Some people have way more problems than their meal tonight. Save your “only 8-9 meals out” money for therapy. Spare the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETA:$5 tip, original bill $60, comped to $20&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromYourServer,"Hi all, I'm new to this sub but I've been waiting/bartending on and off (mostly on) for almost 30 years.  

I believe I have achieved burn out.

I can't stand it anymore.  I'm making stupid mistakes when I'm ringing in orders, and I know I'm better than that.  I think my brain is like ""cut this shit out!""  And it's not customers, most of them are just fine.  It's not my managers or my co-workers or the place I work.  I've worked with enough good and bad managers and co-workers that most of what happens I don't even notice anymore.  I've worked in enough good and bad places to know that where I work now is okay. It's not them, it's me.

I recently got a second job hosting part-time at a place down the street.  Why don't I just take more serving shifts?  Because I can't bring myself to do it. So I told my training manager at my present job that I had gotten a second job hosting, and that I might need to tweak my schedule just a little.  He was cool about it, but was like, you know we need hosts here, right?  No, I didn't know that. So he told me I could host 10-15 hours a week there, and serve three days a week if I want.  At my new second job, I could get more hours with that, plus tips on top of my wage.

Here's my idea:  keep both hosting jobs, and have my manager take me off serving completely.  

I know I'd have to work more both places, possibly 40-50 between the two, but...I kind of see this as my way out of serving, without having to job-hop and hit that weird spot with a new job where you don't have any money coming in for 2 to 3 weeks.

I'm almost afraid to bring this idea up to management, but I think now would be the time to do it, as they have hired a few more servers for the upcoming season, including hosts that they are also training to serve.

When I was about to say my greet, they immediately cut me off and ask, ""I've never been here before, what's good?"" I recommended one dish then suddenly all three of them started to flood me with questions at the same time about everything on the menu. ""How is this? How's that? Hows it cooked? We'll get this, that, this that."" I didn't mind helping them, but I haven't even gotten their drinks yet! I was so lucky I did not have any other tables during this entire encounter. I'm looking at my notepad and it was filled and they were still going.

I pointed out our most popular beef dish and they go, ""nononono, we are vegans. STRICTLY VEGAN. Yes STRICTLYYYYYYYY VEGAN"" Shit.

They also did not like tofu. I double checked with two managers about any other vegan options and they said exactly what I said. There I was, standing for what feels like an eternity telling them the same thing over and over while they try to mod literally EVERYTHING on the menu and getting mad at me because they didn't want the three things I told them. I wasn't getting anywhere so I sent out my manager and she stood there also for what felt like an eternity trying to handle the situation. She came back defeated, I was defeated, she put in their order, yada yada.

Definitely one of those days I'm gonna look back on as just being disappointed with humanity, but yeah. I worked the entire day, was going into the tenth hour of my shift, when I got sat with this table. They were already an issue in the lobby, when the mom screamed at her child for touching her dress, and the dad threw a fit over a ten minute wait bc he ""had children to feed"". 

Couldn't give them our starting appetizer bc they hadn't put in their entree orders, and later when they complained about me that turned into me ""pre-judging them by their appearance"". 

One child's meal came out five minutes after the rest. I assured them that I had put a 911 on it, it was on its way, I was so sorry abt that. That turned into me being ""dismissive and having a poor attitude"". 

Reminded the mother of a check that she got after the regular meal, one for three desserts that she never had any intention to pay for. She cut me off, refused to look at me and threw her hand up, telling me she would get to it. I said ""Okay. Sorry."" Backed off. That turned into me being ""in her ear"". (I was a foot away, but at this point she was too far gone to care). 

They complained that I was ""mean-mugging"" them while they complained. I wasn't ever looking at them- the closest I got was existing nearby for a couple moments, but I very firmly did not want to look at them. Honestly, I can't say the same for every other server there- it was me looking away and five of my coworkers just staring them down. I assume they were too drunk to care that it wasn't me. 


All throughout this, I kept wondering why they were getting worse when I kept going back. The dad  only had two drinks, and a ton of pasta. The mom was drinking tea. Couldn't figure out why they were getting so aggressive and loud about how much they didn't like me when I was getting everything I could for them. Found out later from the hosts that the mom had been wandering outside a couple times while they were there to drink out of a flask. 

They wrote me a letter basically telling me I wasnt charming or smiling enough while they berated me and made fun of me to all of my coworkers, and that I wasn't going to get the $100 bill they brought in for me (???). Claimed to be servers,  but a lot of how they acted about things like wait time or appetizers implies otherwise.
